you're the only cowboy in this place
and if you're up for a rodeo
i'll put a big texas smile on your face
i said girls

i ain't as good as i once was
i got a few years on me now

when i could really lay it down
and if you need some love tonight
then i might have just enough

but i'm as good once as i ever was

verse 2
i still hang out with my best friend dave
i've known him since we were kids at school
last night he had a few shots
got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
with a couple of redneck boys
one great big bad biker man
i heard david yell across the room
hey buddy how 'bout a helping hand

a thousand old sad country songs
but whenever i try to move on

tryna tell a cowboy to slow down

i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire exhale desire
i know it's dire my time today
i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

verse 1
sometimes quiet is violent
i find it hard to hide it my pride is no longer inside
it's on my sleeve my skin will scream
reminding me of who i killed inside my dream
i hate this car that i'm driving there's no hiding for me
i'm forced to deal with what i feel
there is no distraction to mask what is real
i could pull the steering wheel

refrain
i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

i ponder of something terrifying
'cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
i find over the course of our human existence
one thing consists of consistence
and it's that we're all battling fear
oh dear i don't know if we know why we're here
oh my too deep please stop thinking
i liked it better when my car had sound
there are things we can do
but from the things that work there are only two
anda from the two that we choose to do
peace will win and fear will lose
and there's faith and there's sleep
we need to pick one please because
faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive
and i will try with every rhyme
to come across like i am dying
to let you know you need to try to think

i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

verse 1
once i rose above the noise and confusion
just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
i was soaring ever higher
but i flew too high
though my eyes could see i still was a blind man
though my mind could think i still was a mad man
i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
i can hear them say

chorus
carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

verse 2
masquerading as a man with a reason
my charade is the event of the season
and if i claim to be a wise man well
it surely means that i don't know
on a stormy sea of moving emotion
tossed about i'm like a ship on the ocean
i set a course for winds of fortune
but i hear the voices say

i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to
i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to

verse 1
live my life a to z
fill up all the vacancies
feel the vindication from the hate you get for chasing dreams
im major league with or without any cosign
stealing 3rd base no coach no go sign ahhh
that's why i'm feeling how i'm feeling now
music's my escape but it's feeling even realer now
grassroots fuck that we are on some other shit
call it what you want but motherfucker you know what it is
ill fucking bleed for it ask them they know
color me in sepia they are fuckin' day glow
shades on shoes tied shortcuts never work
in it for the long haul pot shots never hurt
thick skinned rhinos elephants we don't forget
what's important overall no withdraw we don't regret
pushing forward even those this life sucks sometimes
fucking with this noose i promise i can get it untied
you made it outta bed task one crossed off
step 2 show them that you ain't gone be a rag doll
stand up backbone strong enough to break falls
ref is tryna make amends look at all those late calls
you might also likechorus
i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to live
i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to breath
i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to ohh
i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to go

verse 2
so many people with the wrong intentions
we've been living with a selfish vision
but i guess it's how we get through it
we take a lesson from the hardships
bet on ourselves grit our teeth and hurry up and get to it
we only get a minute to figure out what our business is
your bucket list is getting long hope you finish it
and in your movie they ain't cast mr nicholson
stumbling over jaded plots better making revisions
it's a different kind of feeling when you're doing what you wanna do
charity is great but you can't help until you make it too
or maybe that's the reason you've been all broken up
vanity keeps you panicked your image isn't focused up
open up and talk about walk it out and talk again
closing off is why you see those fucking walls closing in
break em' down and go outside
live your life don't live the lie
lose the attitude and prove that you know how to be alive
and prove that you can thrive get your money buy the things
but know that honesty and guts is how you bought the ring
and now your married to it scarred up a changed person
reward the hard work looks like the pain was worth it
chorus
i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to live
i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to breath
i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to ohh
i went to sleep and i woke up dead
but i changed my mind and i want to go

verse 3
i'm riding with a heart up on my sleeve
i ain't even sure it's mine but i'm gonna let it be
no instructions to this shit so i add another piece
playing legos with my life i am tryna build a dream
arts and crafts day build it from scratch
construction paper for the skyline the buildings are matchsticks
uh michel gondry with the imagery
and i ain't pop a single pill today so who's to say just who can limit me nobody
old soul more like a spring chicken
when them gears start turning and endorphins start kicking
who's to say what's on the other side
not me not you
you don't need to bless me i just need to hachu
 sick with it pandemic get with it
we are in the same boat we should prolly go fishin' fishin'
and i am feeling like i'm on a mission
so when i wake up please don't tell me any different

sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
whenever you around i seem to come alive for ya
i finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
although i know your man and trust me he would die for ya
these quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
i saw you in the party soft lips softspoken
i came and talked to you but homie interfered now
he introduced you as his girl and i was heartbroken
some people talk about that love at first sight shit
to keep it real i don't know whether i believe it's true
but if it is then tell me if i'm wrong or right if
i fell in love with you before i ever even knew
i catch your eye then look away as if it never happened

and that summer sun had me sweatin' like a dog
so i cooled off in the creek
then it was back to work in the daggum heat

lookin' back now i'm sure glad i didn't
'cause just when i thought it couldn't get no hotter
i caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter

she was just gettin' home from panama city
she was all tanned up and my kinda pretty
when her eyes met mine
i was thinkin' that i would sure love my job
as the days got shorter our talks got longer
the kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
so we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up
every chance we got
we were down by the river all night long
when the sun came up i was sneakin' her home
and draggin' my butt to work
with the smell of her perfume on my shirt
i'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind

whoa and there ain't no better life for me

chorus
i'm still haulin' hay and feedin' the hogs
and that summer sun's got me sweatin' like a dog
so i cool off in the creek
and she brings me outta glass of sweet ice tea
i'm on the tractor and she's on my mind
and i can't wait 'til it's quitin' time
and just when i think it can't get no hotter
i come home to the farmer's daughter
yeah the farmer's daughter

as a kid was a skid and no one knew me by name
trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

prechorus

attention that we crave

become another casualty of society
i'll never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity and back down

verse 2
because you don't know us at all we laugh when old people fall
but what would you expect with a conscience so small
heavy metal and mullets it's how we were raised
maiden and priest were the gods that we praised

prechorus
'cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense and
cuttin' people down is just a minor offense then
it's none of your concern

it's impossible it's not probable
you're irresponsible too many obstacles
you gotta stop it yo you gotta take it slow
you can't be a pro don't waste your time no more
who the fuck are you to tell me what to do
i don't give a damn if you say you disapprove
i'm gonna make my move i'm gonna make it soon
and i'll do it 'cause it's what i want to fucking do
'cause all these opinions and all these positions
they're coming in millions they're blocking your vision

of illinois held at bloomington

on may 29 1856

from the report by william c whitney

mr whitney's notes were made at the time but not written out until 1896 he does not claim that the speech as here reported is literally correct only that he has followed the argument and that in many cases the sentences are as mr lincoln spoke them

mr chairman and gentlemen i was over at cries of platform take the platformi say that while i was at danville court some of our friends of antinebraska got together in springfield and elected me as one delegate to represent old sangamon with them in this convention and i am here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement and by virtue of that meeting and selection but we can hardly be called delegates strictly inasmuch as properly speaking we represent nobody but ourselves i think it altogether fair to say that we have no antinebraska party in sangamon although there is a good deal of antinebraska feeling there but i say for myself and i think i may speak also for my colleagues that we who are here fully approve of the platform and of all that has been done a voice yes and even if we are not regularly delegates it will be right for me to answer your call to speak i suppose we truly stand for the public sentiment of sangamon on the great question of the repeal although we do not yet represent many numbers who have taken a distinct position on the question
we are in a trying timeit ranges above mere partyand this movement to call a halt and turn our steps backward needs all the help and good counsels it can get for unless popular opinion makes itself very strongly felt and a change is made in our present course blood will flow on account of nebraska and brother's hands will be raised against brother

the last sentence was uttered in such an earnest impressive if not indeed tragic manner as to make a cold chill creep over me others gave a similar experience

i have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal made to illinois men by the gentleman from lawrence james s emery who has just addressed us so eloquently and forcibly i was deeply moved by his statement of the wrongs done to freestate men out there i think it just to say that all true men north should sympathize with them and ought to be willing to do any possible and needful thing to right their wrongs but we must not promise what we ought not lest we be called on to perform what we cannot we must be calm and moderate and consider the whole difficulty and determine what is possible and just we must not be led by excitement and passion to do that which our sober judgments would not approve in our cooler moments we have higher aims we will have more serious business than to dally with temporary measures

we are here to stand firmly for a principleto stand firmly for a right we know that great political and moral wrongs are done and outrages committed and we denounce those wrongs and outrages although we cannot at present do much more but we desire to reach out beyond those personal outrages and establish a rule that will apply to all and so prevent any future outrages

we have seen today that every shade of popular opinion is represented here with freedom or rather free soil as the basis we have come together as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the extension of slavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law and the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more we comewe are here assembled togetherto protest as well as we can against a great wrong and to take measures as well as we now can to make that wrong right to place the nation as far as it may be possible now as it was before the repeal of the missouri compromise and the plain way to do this is to restore the compromise and to demand and determine that kansas shall be free immense applause while we affirm and reaffirm if necessary our devotion to the principles of the declaration of independence let our practical work here be limited to the above we know that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment here on the public questions which might be rightfully considered in this convention and that the indignation which we all must feel cannot be helped but all of us must give up something for the good of the cause there is one desire which is uppermost in the mind one wish common to us all to which no dissent will be made and i counsel you earnestly to bury all resentment to sink all personal feeling make all things work to a common purpose in which we are united and agreed about and which all present will agree is absolutely necessarywhich must be done by any rightful mode if there be such slavery must be kept out of kansas applause the testthe pinchis right there if we lose kansas to freedom an example will be set which will prove fatal to freedom in the end we therefore in the language of the bible must lay the axe to the root of the tree temporizing will not do longer now is the time for decisionfor firm persistent resolute action applause

the nebraska bill or rather nebraska law is not one of wholesome legislation but was and is an act of legislative usurpation whose result if not indeed intention is to make slavery national and unless headed off in some effective way we are in a fair way to see this land of boasted freedom converted into a land of slavery in fact sensation just open your two eyes and see if this be not so i need do no more than state to command universal approval that almost the entire north as well as a large following in the border states is radically opposed to the planting of slavery in free territory probably in a popular vote throughout the nation nine tenths of the voters in the free states and at least onehalf in the border states if they could express their sentiments freely would vote no on such an issue and it is safe to say that two thirds of the votes of the entire nation would be opposed to it and yet in spite of this overbalancing of sentiment in this free country we are in a fair way to see kansas present itself for admission as a slave state indeed it is a felony by the local law of kansas to deny that slavery exists there even now by every principle of law a negro in kansas is free yet the bogus legislature makes it an infamous crime to tell him that he is free

statutes of kansas 1555 chapter 151 sec 12 if any free person by speaking or by writing assert or maintain that persons have not the right to hold slaves in this territory or shall introduce into this territory print publish write circulate    any book paper magazine pamphlet or circular containing any denial of the right of persons to hold slaves in this territory such person shall be deemed guilty of felony and punished by imprisonment at hard labor for a term of not less than two years sec 13 no person who is conscientiously opposed to holding slaves or who does not admit the right to hold slaves in this territory shall sit as a juror on the trial of any prosecution for any violation of any sections of this act

the party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and liberty for it is a singular fact but none the less a fact and well known by the most common experience that men will do things under the terror of the party lash that they would not on any account or for any consideration do otherwise while men who will march up to the mouth of a loaded cannon without shrinking will run from the terrible name of abolitionist even when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they with good reason despise for instanceto press this point a littlejudge douglas introduced his nebraska bill in january and we had an extra session of our legislature in the succeeding february in which were seventyfive democrats and at a party caucus fully attended there were just three votes out of the whole seventyfive for the measure but in a few days orders came on from washington commanding them to approve the measure the party lash was applied and it was brought up again in caucus and passed by a large majority the masses were against it but party necessity carried it and it was passed through the lower house of congress against the will of the people for the same reason here is where the greatest danger lies that while we profess to be a government of law and reason law will give way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing power like the great juggernauti think that is the namethe great idol it crushes everything that comes in its way and makes a or as i read once in a blackletter law book a slave is a human being who is legally not a person but a thing and if the safeguards to liberty are broken down as is now attempted when they have made things of all the free negroes how long think you before they will begin to make things of poor white men applause be not deceived revolutions do not go backward the founder of the democratic party declared that all men were created equal his successor in the leadership has written the word white before men making it read all white men are created equal pray will or may not the knownothings if they should get in power add the word protestant making it read all protestant white men
meanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in other quarters john pettit whom tom benton paid his respects to you will recollect calls the immortal declaration a selfevident lie while at the birthplace of freedomin the shadow of bunker hill and of the cradle of liberty at the home of the adamses and warren and otischoate from our side of the house dares to fritter away the birthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the declaration to be a string of glittering generalities and the southern whigs working hand in hand with proslavery democrats are making choate's theories practical thomas jefferson a slaveholder mindful of the moral element in slavery solemnly declared that he trembled for his country when he remembered that god is just while judge douglas with an insignificant wave of the hand don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down now if slavery is right or even negative he has a right to treat it in this trifling manner but if it is a moral and political wrong as all christendom considers it to be how can he answer to god for this attempt to spread and fortify it applause

but no man and judge douglas no more than any other can maintain a negative or merely neutral position on this question and accordingly he avows that the union was made by white men and for white men and their descendants as matter of fact the first branch of the proposition is historically true the government was made by white men and they were and are the superior race this i admit but the cornerstone of the government so to speak was the declaration that all men are created equal and all entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness applause

and not only so but the framers of the constitution were particular to keep out of that instrument the word slave the reason being that slavery would ultimately come to an end and they did not wish to have any reminder that in this free country human beings were ever prostituted to slavery applause nor is it any argument that we are superior and the negro inferiorthat he has but one talent while we have ten let the negro possess the little he has in independence if he has but one talent he should be permitted to keep the little he has applause but slavery will endure no test of reason or logic and yet its advocates like douglas use a sort of bastard logic or noisy assumption it might better be termed like the above in order to prepare the mind for the gradual but none the less certain encroachments of the moloch of slavery upon the fair domain of freedom but however much you may argue upon it or smother it in soft phrase slavery can only be maintained by forceby violence the repeal of the missouri compromise was by violence it was a violation of both law and the sacred obligations of honor to overthrow and trample under foot a solemn compromise obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of one of the fairest of our western domains congress violated the will and confidence of its constituents in voting for the bill and while public sentiment as shown by the elections of 1854 demanded the restoration of this compromise congress violated its trust by refusing simply because it had the force of numbers to hold on to it and murderous violence is being used now in order to force slavery on to kansas for it cannot be done in any other way sensation

the necessary result was to establish the rule of violenceforce instead of the rule of law and reason to perpetuate and spread slavery and in time to make it general we see it at both ends of the line in washington on the very spot where the outrage was started the fearless sumner is beaten to insensibility and is now slowly dying while senators who claim to be gentlemen and christians stood by countenancing the act and even applauding it afterward in their places in the senate even douglas our man saw it all and was within helping distance yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed then at the other end of the line at the very time sumner was being murdered lawrence was being destroyed for the crime of freedom it was the most prominent stronghold of liberty in kansas and must give way to the alldominating power of slavery only two days ago judge trumbull found it necessary to propose a bill in the senate to prevent a general civil war and to restore peace in kansas

we live in the midst of alarms anxiety beclouds the future we expect some new disaster with each newspaper we read are we in a healthful political state are not the tendencies plain do not the signs of the times point plainly the way in which we are going sensation
in the early days of the constitution slavery was recognized by south and north alike as an evil and the division of sentiment about it was not controlled by geographical lines or considerations of climate but by moral and philanthropic views petitions for the abolition of slavery were presented to the very first congress by virginia and massachusetts alike to show the harmony which prevailed i will state that a fugitive slave law was passed in 1793 with no dissenting voice in the senate and but seven dissenting votes in the house it was however a wise law moderate and under the constitution a just one twentyfive years later a more stringent law was proposed and defeated and thirtyfive years after that the present law drafted by mason of virginia was passed by northern votes i am not just now complaining of this law but i am trying to show how the current sets for the proposed law of 1817 was far less offensive than the present one in 1774 the continental congress pledged itself without a dissenting vote to wholly discontinue the slave trade and to neither purchase nor import any slave and less than three months before the passage of the declaration of independence the same congress which adopted that declaration unanimously resolved that no slave be imported into any of the thirteen united colonies great applause

on the second day of july 1776 the draft of a declaration of independence was reported to congress by the committee and in it the slave trade was characterized as an execrable commerce as a piratical warfare as the opprobrium of infidel powers and as a cruel war against human nature applause all agreed on this except south carolina and georgia and in order to preserve harmony and from the necessity of the case these expressions were omitted indeed abolition societies existed as far south as virginia and it is a wellknown fact that washington jefferson madison lee henry mason and pendleton were qualified abolitionists and much more radical on that subject than we of the whig and democratic parties claim to be today on march 1 1784 virginia ceded to the confederation all its lands lying northwest of the ohio river jefferson chase of maryland and howell of rhode island as a committee on that and territory thereafter to be ceded reported that no slavery should exist after the year 1800 had this report been adopted not only the northwest but kentucky tennessee alabama and mississippi also would have been free but it required the assent of nine states to ratify it north carolina was divided and thus its vote was lost and delaware georgia and new jersey refused to vote in point of fact as it was it was assented to by six states three years later on a square vote to exclude slavery from the northwest only one vote and that from new york was against it and yet thirtyseven years later five thousand citizens of illinois out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand deliberately after a long and heated contest voted to introduce slavery in illinois and today a large party in the free state of illinois are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the fair domain of kansas notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom long before its birth as a political community i repeat therefore the question is it not plain in what direction we are tending sensation in the colonial time mason pendleton and jefferson were as hostile to slavery in virginia as otis ames and the adamses were in massachusetts and virginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it as old massachusetts did but circumstances were against them and they failed but not that the good will of its leading men was lacking yet within less than fifty years virginia changed its tune and made negrobreeding for the cotton and sugar states one of its leading industries laughter and applause

in the constitutional convention george mason of virginia made a more violent abolition speech than my friends lovejoy or codding would desire to make here todaya speech which could not be safely repeated anywhere on southern soil in this enlightened year but while there were some differences of opinion on this subject even then discussion was allowed but as you see by the kansas slave code which as you know is the missouri slave code merely ferried across the river it is a felony to even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of washington and the declaration of independence sensation

in kentuckymy statein 1849 on a test vote the mighty influence of henry clay and many other good then there could not get a symptom of expression in favor of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of marching toward the light of civilization with ohio and illinois but the state of boone and hardin and henry clay with a nigger under each arm took the black trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism is therecan there beany doubt about this thing and is there any doubt that we must all lay aside our prejudices and march shoulder to shoulder in the great army of freedom applause

every fourth of july our young orators all proclaim this to be the land of the free and the home of the brave well now when you orators get that off next year and may be this very year how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it laughter how would you like that but suppose kansas comes in as a slave state and all the border ruffians have barbecues about it and freestate men come trailing back to the dishonored north like whipped dogs with their tails between their legs it isain't itevident that this is no more the land of the free and if we let it go so we won't dare to say home of the brave out loud sensation and confusion
can any man doubt that even in spite of the people's will slavery will triumph through violence unless that will be made manifest and enforced even governor reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in kansas was to be fair but he got his eyes open at last and i believe that as a result of this moral and physical violence kansas will soon apply for admission as a slave state and yet we can't mistake that the people don't want it so and that it is a land which is free both by natural and political law no law is free law such is the understanding of all christendom in the somerset case decided nearly a century ago the great lord mansfield held that slavery was of such a nature that it must take its rise in positive as distinguished from natural law and that in no country or age could it be traced back to any other source will some one please tell me where is the positive law that establishes slavery in kansas a voice the bogus laws aye the bogus laws and on the same principle a gang of missouri horsethieves could come into illinois and declare horsestealing to be legal laughter and it would be just as legal as slavery is in kansas but by express statute in the land of washington and jefferson we may soon be brought face to face with the discreditable fact of showing to the world by our acts that we prefer slavery to freedomdarkness to light sensation

it is i believe a principle in law that when one party to a contract violates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is made the other party may rescind it i will ask browning if that ain't good law voices yes well now if that be right i go for rescinding the whole entire missouri compromise and thus turning missouri into a free state and i should like to know the differenceshould like for any one to point out the differencebetween our making a free state of missouri and their making a slave state of kansas great applause there ain't one bit of difference except that our way would be a great mercy to humanity but i have never said and the whig party has never said and those who oppose the nebraska bill do not as a body say that they have any intention of interfering with slavery in the slave states our platform says just the contrary we allow slavery to exist in the slave states not because slavery is right or good but from the necessities of our union we grant a fugitive slave law because it is so nominated in the bond because our fathers so stipulatedhad toand we are bound to carry out this agreement but they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions where it did not previously exist on the contrary they said by their example and teachings that they did not deem it expedientdid n't consider it rightto do so and it is wise and right to do just as they did about it voices good and that it what we proposenot to interfere with slavery where it exists we have never tried to do it and to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law a voice no i say yes applause it was part of the bargain and i 'm for living up to it but i go no further i'm not bound to do more and i won't agree any further great applause

we here in illinois should feel especially proud of the provision of the missouri compromise excluding slavery from what is now kansas for an illinois man jesse b thomas was its father henry clay who is credited with the authorship of the compromise in general terms did not even vote for that provision but only advocated the ultimate admission by a second compromise and thomas was beyond all controversy the real author of the slavery restriction branch of the compromise to show the generosity of the northern members toward the southern side on a test vote to exclude slavery from missouri ninety voted not to exclude and eightyseven to exclude every vote from the slave states being ranged with the former and fourteen votes from the free states of whom seven were from new england alone while on a vote to exclude slavery from what is now kansas the vote was one hundred and thirtyfour for to fortytwo against the scheme as a whole was of course a southern triumph it is idle to contend otherwise as is now being done by the nebraskites it was so shown by the votes and quite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men mr lowndes of south carolina was never known to commit a political mistake his was the great judgment of that section and he declared that this measure would restore tranquillity to the countrya result demanded by every consideration of discretion of moderation of wisdom and of virtue when the measure came before president monroe for his approval he put to each member of his cabinet this question has congress the constitutional power to prohibit slavery in a territory and john c calhoun and william h crawford from the south equally with john quincy adams benjamin rush and smith thompson from the north alike answered yes without qualification or equivocation and this measure of so great consequence to the south was passed and missouri was by means of it finally enabled to knock at the door of the republic for an open passage to its brood of slaves and in spite of this freedom's share is about to be taken by violenceby the force of misrepresentative votes not called for by the popular will what name can i in common decency give to this wicked transaction sensation

but even then the contest was not over for when the missouri constitution came before congress for its approval it forbade any free negro or mulatto from entering the state in short our illinois black laws were hidden away in their constitution laughter and the controversy was thus revived then it was that mr clay's talents shone out conspicuously and the controversy that shook the union to its foundation was finally settled to the satisfaction of the conservative parties on both sides of the line though not to the extremists on either and missouri was admitted by the small majority of six in the lower house how great a majority do you think would have been given had kansas also been secured for slavery a voice a majority the other way a majority the other way is answered do you think it would have been safe for a northern man to have confronted his constituents after having voted to consign both missouri and kansas to hopeless slavery and yet this man douglas who misrepresents his constituents and who has exerted his highest talents in that direction will be carried in triumph through the state and hailed with honor while applauding that act three groans for dug and this shows whither we are tending this thing of slavery is more powerful than its supporterseven than the high priests that minister at its altar it debauches even our greatest men it gathers strength like a rolling snowball by its own infamy monstrous crimes are committed in its name by persons collectively which they would not dare to commit as individuals its aggressions and encroachments almost surpass belief in a despotism one might not wonder to see slavery advance steadily and remorselessly into new dominions but is it not wonderful is it not even alarming to see its steady advance in a land dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal sensation
it yields nothing itself it keeps all it has and gets all it can besides it really came dangerously near securing illinois in 1824 it did get missouri in 1821 the first proposition was to admit what is now arkansas and missouri as one slave state but the territory was divided and arkansas came in without serious question as a slave state and afterwards missouri not as a sort of equality free but also as a slave state then we had florida and texas and now kansas is about to be forced into the dismal procession sensation and so it is wherever you look we have not forgottenit is but six years sincehow dangerously near california came to being a slave state texas is a slave state and four other slave states may be carved from its vast domain and yet in the year 1829 slavery was abolished throughout that vast region by a royal decree of the then sovereign of mexico will you please tell me by what right slavery exists in texas today by the same right as and no higher or greater than slavery is seeking dominion in kansas by political forcepeaceful if that will suffice by the torch as in kansas and the bludgeon as in the senate chamber if required and so history repeats itself and even as slavery has kept its course by craft intimidation and violence in the past so it will persist in my judgment until met and dominated by the will of a people bent on its restriction

we have this very afternoon heard bitter denunciations of brooks in washington and titus stringfellow atchison jones and shannon in kansasthe battleground of slavery i certainly am not going to advocate or shield them but they and their acts are but the necessary outcome of the nebraska law we should reserve our highest censure for the authors of the mischief and not for the catspaws which they use i believe it was shakespeare who said where the offence lies there let the axe fall and in my opinion this man douglas and the northern men in congress who advocate nebraska are more guilty than a thousand joneses and stringfellows with all their murderous practices can be applause

we have made a good beginning here today as our methodist friends would say i feel it is good to be here while extremists may find some fault with the moderation of our platform they should recollect that the battle is not always to the strong nor the race to the swift in grave emergencies moderation is generally safer than radicalism and as this struggle is likely to be long and earnest we must not by our action repel any who are in sympathy with us in the main but rather win all that we can to our standard we must not belittle nor overlook the facts of our conditionthat we are new and comparatively weak while our enemies are entrenched and relatively strong they have the administration and the political power and right or wrong at present they have the numbers our friends who urge an appeal to arms with so much force and eloquence should recollect that the government is arrayed against us and that the numbers are now arrayed against us as well or to state it nearer to the truth they are not yet expressly and affirmatively for us and we should repel friends rather than gain them by anything savoring of revolutionary methods as it now stands we must appeal to the sober sense and patriotism of the people we will make converts day by day we will grow strong by calmness and moderation we will grow strong by the violence and injustice of our adversaries and unless truth be a mockery and justice a hollow lie we will be in the majority after a while and then the revolution which we will accomplish will be none the less radical from being the result of pacific measures the battle of freedom is to be fought out on principle slavery is a violation of the eternal right we have temporized with it from the necessities of our condition but as sure as god reigns and school children read that black foul lie can never be consecrated into god's hallowed truth immense applause lasting some time

one of our greatest difficulties is that men who know that slavery is a detestable crime and ruinous to the nation are compelled by our peculiar condition and other circumstances to advocate it concretely though damning it in the raw henry clay was a brilliant example of this tendency others of our purest statesmen are compelled to do so and thus slavery secures actual support from those who detest it at heart yet henry clay perfected and forced through the compromise which secured to slavery a great state as well as a political advantage not that he hated slavery less but that he loved the whole union more as long as slavery profited by his great compromise the hosts of proslavery could not sufficiently cover him with praise but now that this compromise stands in their way

they never mention him
his name is never heard
their lips are now forbid to speak
that once familiar word

they have slaughtered one of his most cherished measures and his ghost would arise to rebuke them great applause

now let us harmonize my friends and appeal to the moderation and patriotism of the people to the sober second thought to the awakened public conscience the repeal of the sacred missouri compromise has installed the weapons of violence the bludgeon the incendiary torch the deathdealing rifle the bristling cannonthe weapons of kingcraft of the inquisition of ignorance of barbarism of oppression we see its fruits in the dying bed of the heroic sumner in the ruins of the free state hotel in the smoking embers of the herald of freedom in the freestate governor of kansas chained to a stake on freedom's soil like a horsethief for the crime of freedom applause we see it in christian statesmen and christian newspapers and christian pulpits applauding the cowardly act of a low bully who crawled upon his victim behind his back and dealt the deadly blow sensation and applause we note our political demoralization in the catchwords that are coming into such common use on the one hand freedomshriekers and sometimes freedomscreechers laughter and on the other hand borderruffians and that fully deserved and the significance of catchwords cannot pass unheeded for they constitute a sign of the times everything in this world jibes in with everything else and all the fruits of this nebraska bill are like the poisoned source from which they come i will not say that we may not sooner or later be compelled to meet force by force but the time has not yet come and if we are true to ourselves may never come do not mistake that the ballot is stronger than the bullet therefore let the legions of slavery use bullets but let us wait patiently till november and fire ballots at them in return and by that peaceful policy i believe we shall ultimately win applause

it was by that policy that here in illinois the early fathers fought the good fight and gained the victory in 1824 the free men of our state led by governor coles who was a native of maryland and president madison's private secretary determined that those beautiful groves should never reecho the dirge of one who has no title to himself by their resolute determination the winds that sweep across our broad prairies shall never cool the parched brow nor shall the unfettered streams that bring joy and gladness to our free soil water the tired feet of a slave but so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling streams bless the land or the groves and their fragrance or memory remain the humanity to which they minister shall be forever free great applause palmer yates williams browning and some more in this convention came from kentucky to illinois instead of going to missouri not only to better their conditions but also to get away from slavery they have said so to me and it is understood among us kentuckians that we don't like it one bit now can we mindful of the blessings of liberty which the early men of illinois left to us refuse a like privilege to the free men who seek to plant freedom's banner on our western outposts no no should we not stand by our neighbors who seek to better their conditions in kansas and nebraska yes yes can we as christian men and strong and free ourselves wield the sledge or hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed race no no woe unto them it is written that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty no no

one great trouble in the matter is that slavery is an insidious and crafty power and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well as by sly management of the peaceful even after the ordinance of 1787 the settlers in indiana and illinois it was all one government then tried to get congress to allow slavery temporarily and petitions to that end were sent from kaskaskia and general harrison the governor urged it from vincennes the capital if that had succeeded goodbye to liberty here but john randolph of virginia made a vigorous report against it and although they persevered so well as to get three favorable reports for it yet the united states senate with the aid of some slave states finally squelched if for good applause and that is why this hall is today a temple for free men instead of a negro liverystable great applause and laughter once let slavery get planted in a locality by ever so weak or doubtful a title and in ever so small numbers and it is like the canada thistle or bermuda grassyou can't root it out you yourself may detest slavery but your neighbor has five or six slaves and he is an excellent neighbor or your son has married his daughter and they beg you to help save their property and you vote against your interests and principle to accommodate a neighbor hoping that your vote will be on the losing side and others do the same and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold and when that is done the whole mighty unionthe force of the nationis committed to its support and that very process is working in kansas today and you must recollect that the slave property is worth a billion of dollars while freestate men must work for sentiment alone then there are blue lodgesas they call themeverywhere doing their secret and deadly work

it is a very strange thing and not solvable by any moral law that i know of that if a man loses his horse the whole country will turn out to help hang the thief but if a man but a shade or two darker than i am is himself stolen the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring him to liberty such are the inconsistencies of slavery where a horse is more sacred than a man and the essence of squatter or popular sovereigntyi don't care how you call itis that if one man chooses to make a slave of another no third man shall be allowed to object and if you can do this in free kansas and it is allowed to stand the next thing you will see is shiploads of negroes from africa at the wharf at charleston for one thing is as truly lawful as the other and these are the bastard notions we have got to stamp out else they will stamp us out sensation and applause

two years ago at springfield judge douglas avowed that illinois came into the union as a slave state and that slavery was weeded out by the operation of his great patent everlasting principle of popular sovereignty laughter well now that argument must be answered for it has a little grain of truth at the bottom i do not mean that it is true in essence as he would have us believe it could not be essentially true if the ordinance of '87 was valid but in point of fact there were some degraded beings called slaves in kaskaskia and the other french settlements when our first state constitution was adopted that is a fact and i don't deny it slaves were brought here as early as 1720 and were kept here in spite of the ordinance of 1787 against it but slavery did not thrive here on the contrary under the influence of the ordinance the number decreased fiftyone from 1810 to 1820 while under the influence of squatter sovereignty right across the river in missouri they increased seven thousand two hundred and eleven in the same time and slavery finally faded out in illinois under the influence of the law of freedom while it grew stronger and stronger in missouri under the law or practice of popular sovereignty in point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen slaves in illinois one year after its admission or one to every four hundred and seventy of its population or to state it in another way if illinois was a slave state in 1820 so were new york and new jersey much greater slave states from having had greater numbers slavery having been established there in very early times but there is this vital difference between all these states and the judge's kansas experiment that they sought to disestablish slavery which had been already established while the judge seeks so far as he can to disestablish freedom which had been established there by the missouri compromise voices good

the union is undergoing a fearful strain but it is a stout old ship and has weathered many a hard blow and the stars in their courses aye an invisible power greater than the puny efforts of men will fight for us but we ourselves must not decline the burden of responsibility nor take counsel of unworthy passions whatever duty urges us to do or to omit must be done or omitted and the recklessness with which our adversaries break the laws or counsel their violation should afford no example for us therefore let us revere the declaration of independence let us continue to obey the constitution and the laws let us keep step to the music of the union let us draw a cordon so to speak around the slave states and the hateful institution like a reptile poisoning itself will perish by its own infamy applause
but we cannot be free men if this is by our national choice to be a land of slavery those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under the rule of a just god cannot long retain itloud applause

did you ever my friends seriously reflect upon the speed with which we are tending downwards within the memory of men now present the leading statesman of virginia could make genuine redhot abolitionist speeches in old virginia and as i have said now even in free kansas it is a crime to declare that it is free kansas the very sentiments that i and others have just uttered would entitle us and each of us to the ignominy and seclusion of a dungeon and yet i suppose that like paul we were free born but if this thing is allowed to continue it will be but one step further to impress the same rule in illinois sensation

the conclusion of all is that we must restore the missouri compromise we must highly resolve that kansas must be free great applause we must reinstate the birthday promise of the republic we must reaffirm the declaration of independence we must make good in essence as well as in form madison's avowal that the word slave ought not to appear in the constitution and we must even go further and decree that only local law and not that timehonored instrument shall shelter a slaveholder we must make this a land of liberty in fact as it is in name but in seeking to attain these resultsso indispensable if the liberty which is our pride and boast shall endurewe will be loyal to the constitution and to the flag of our union and no matter what our grievanceeven though kansas shall come in as a slave state and no matter what theirseven if we shall restore the compromisewe will say to the southern disunionists we won't go out of the union and you shan't
this was the climax the audience rose to its feet en masse applauded stamped waved handkerchiefs threw hats in the air and ran riot for several minutes the archenchanter who wrought this transformation looked meanwhile like the personification of political justice

but let us meanwhile appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people and not to their prejudices let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here aroused all over these vast prairies so suggestive of freedom let us commence by electing the gallant soldier governor colonel
bissell who stood for the honor of our state alike on the plains and amidst the chaparral of mexico and on the floor of congress while he defied the southern hotspur and that will have a greater moral effect than all the border ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on kansas there is both a power and a magic in popular opinion to that let us now appeal and while in all probability no resort to force will be needed our moderation and forbearance will stand us in good stead when if ever we must make an appeal to battle and to the god of hosts immense applause and a rush for the orator

one can realize with this ability to move people's minds that the southern conspiracy were right to hate this man he better than any at the time was able to uncover their stratagems and tear down their sophisms and contradictionsembed"

orange koolaid go good with patron
oh no hell no boy is still my ring tone
free car wash had to clean up the dodge
give back when i can just playin' my part
church folks had a fish fry mustard hot sauce
light bread and french fries love for the big guy
hit the park boys showin' off their hops
nappy roots on the radio and you know it bop

take the day off hit the park and just hang
barbeque roll a few and put up your deuce
if it's beef put down the piece down throw up your dukes
it's time to change our ways so we can save the day
for the children's sake and make a better place to play
and if it's all good break out your coop and grip your wood
and if you're ridin' dirty light your spliff and blow your
but do it real big exactly like a player should
enjoy your 24 do your thing and rep your hood
the world is all yours but still we all grind
forever and a day the choice you make is really all fine

i was sitting there selling turnips on a flatbed truck
crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
she had to be thinking this is where rednecks come from
she had hollywood written on her license plate
she was lost and looking for the interstate
needing directions and i was the man for the job

chorus
i told her way up yonder past the caution light
there's a little country store with an old coke sign
you got to stop in and ask miss bell for some of her sweet tea
then a left will take you to the interstate
but a right will bring you right back here to me

verse 2
i was sitting there thinking about her pretty face
kicking myself for not catching her name
i threw my hat and thought you fool it could have been love
i knew my old ford couldn't run her down
she probably didn't like me anyhow
so i watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

chorus
i told her way up yonder past the caution light
there's a little country store with an old coke sign
you got to stop in and ask miss bell for some of her sweet tea
then a left will take you to the interstate
but a right will bring you right back here to me

don't know why but something felt right
when she stopped in and asked miss bell
for some of her sweet tea
mama gave her a big old glass
and sent her right back here to me

was a boy who was a dreamer and he flew so high and proud
in a world full of people out to cut his young ass down
no one ever understood a single word he said
and they cast him to the wolves when he wasnt well and fed

verse 2
boys weve got a riser a riser in our midst
he will get the last laugh if its the last thing he did
and he used to roll around in that red dirt mud
but now hes skipping town and that riser's out for blood

chorus
dont stop goin goin south
'cause theyll let you play your music real damn loud
dont stop headin headin south
'cause they will understand th words that are pouring from your mouth

verse 3
then that boy he calld his daddy to tell him what he did
as the masses scream the lyrics of a messed up kid
and then he told that old man he was never comin' back
to be cut down again in a town like that

bridge
then he surely came to learn people come to watch you fall
he's out to make a name and a fool out of em all
and theyll never understand that boy and his kind
all they comprehend is a fuckin' dollar sign

they all laughed as he turned around slow
they said you ain't welcome round here anymore
you just might as well go
he wiped the blood from his face as he slowly came to his knees
he said i'll be back when you least expect it
and hell's coming with me
hells coming with me

verse 2
there is a hill at the bottom of the valley
where all the poor souls go when they die
and if you listen real close you can hear 'em like a ghost
saying you're never gonna make it out alive
there is a town at the bottom of that hill
they got a secret that they keep like a slave
they got a black magic preacher and we'd do well to let him teach ya
you'll be heading up that hill to the grave

chorus
and it is well with my soul
you line your pockets full of money that you steal from the poor
and on your way down the hill you hear me ring that bell
i'd pay the devil twice as much to keep your soul

verse 3
there was a drifter passing through that little valley
see he had promised he was coming back to town
coming back to town
they didn't know him by his face or by the gun around his waist
but he'd come back to burn that town to the ground
first there was fire
then there was smoke
then that preacher man was hangin by a rope
and then they all fell to their knees and begged that drifter
begged him please as he raised his fist before he spoke

you can have the sound of a thousand voices calling your name
you can have the light of the world blind you bathe you in grace
but i don't see so easily what you hold in your hands
'cause castles crumble kingdoms fall and turn into sand

verse 2
you can be an angel of mercy or give into hate
you can try to fight it just like every other careless mistake
how do you justify i'm mystified by the ways of your heart
with a million lies the truth will rise to tear you apart

whoa

chorus
no one gets out alive
every day is do or die
the one thing you leave behind
is how did you love how did you love
it's not what you believe
those prayers will make you bleed
but while you're on your knees
how did you love how did you love
how did you love

verse 3
nothing ever feels quite the same when you are what you dreamed

not today just please not today i cant tell you how i so do not need this today

    its barely five thirty in the morning and already my whole life seems to be spiralling dangerously out of all control something thats happening with alltoo alarming frequency these days for starters while im trying to slip out the door at the crack of dawn nothing unusual there this is when i have to leave for work every morning elka my polish nanny picks today of all shagging days to have an outandout meltdown

    there i am sneaking downstairs in my bare feet trying not to wake anyone already running late for the early morning news briefing never ever a good start to the day next thing madam stomps out of her bedroom still in her dressing gown not so much asking as demanding to have a queek word with you

    emm  yes of course elka i say instantly smelling trouble and deliberately keeping my voice down to a low hiss so as not to disturb lily

    lily by the way is my little girl almost three years old now and the light of this exhausted knackeredtoherverybonemarrow mummys life

    is everything ok i ask politely biting my tongue and bracing myself for the answer elka is the one nanny weve had who lily adores and behaves beautifully for and for her part elka herself genuinely seems fond of her too

    i neeeeed to speak with you and this crazy hour of morning is only time i am seeing you all this week she tells me in her stillrubbishy english in spite of the small fortune ive forked out on audio books and private lessons for her over the past few months

    please dont tell me youre about to leave please for the love of god dont let another one leave 

    go ahead elka i manage to say calmly but with bowels clenched only dreading whats going to come out of her mouth next

    in my contract it say that you am paying me to look after lily she says crisply arms folded ponytail swishing back nostrils flaring but you must understand me when i tell to you this mean during reasoning hours

    i think you might mean reasonable hours i tell her can i ask you whats suddenly brought all this on

    you have huge nerve to ask that of me
    shhh can you keep it down please youll wake lily

    i have many many problem with the hours you expect me to be working none of the other nannies who am my friends work as long days as i must

    but elka your hours are hardly long at least not compared with mine theyre not 

    look at time now five thirty am and already you are going to office which mean i am in care of lily you meant to be home at seven in the night times so i can have free time for me and you never are ever

    okay im momentarily silenced here because actually the girl does have a point technically im supposed to be home at sevenish in the evening so she can clock off but  well for the past while its been a tiny bit later than that like eleven pm or even midnight

    all other nannies have evenings free they am all meeting for coffee and beer and movies all having good time in ireland all have boyfriends and days off and nights out but never me no fun for me ever i tell you i am sick of it have enough is total crap

    shhh elka please will you keep your voice down i stage whisper at her but madams having none of it instead shes whipped herself up into a right frenzy and theres no stopping her now

    no you must be listening to me because you am working late i must too its too much and i want to quit

    i hear what youre saying and i completely understand but can i also remind you that this is the nature of my job i tell her as soothingly as i can knowing full well she has me backed into a corner now because if she walks out on me  oh dear god it just doesnt bear thinking about

    and if you dont like the schedule i have to work elka well  im really sorry but theres absolutely nothing i can do about it believe me i dont like working such long hours any more than you do so if youre looking for someone to blame then take it up with  eurozone leaders and the global economic meltdown or  blame the arab spring in the middle east which is hardly my fault now is it

    i no understand  you must use little words for me

    i take another deep breath

    im so sorry elka i tell her as calmly as i can given that i should have been out the door ten minutes ago and even though the day has barely started im now already well behind schedule but if theres a big news story the editor has to be there to oversee it thats my life news doesnt take time off and therefore neither can i editors at the post dont sit around in fairness i did make this perfectly clear to you when i hired you plus can i point out that i pay you far and above the rates all your other nanny pals are earning but of course i tack on brightly hoping against hope that this might just work if its a question of giving you yet another salary increase id be perfectly happy to discuss it with you later
    no not even that sways her though in fact i might as well be talking to the back of my hand

    you work too long days and it no good for lily as well as no good for me she lobs in a cheap shot if ever there was one the old emotional guiltcard thrown at a busy working mother

    she miss her mama so much when you not here all the time she ask me when is mama coming home

    come on elka that is blatantly ridiculous and deeply hurtful 

    even at the weekend time when you should be with her you am still in the office always always working

    now that bloody stung and just as this conversation was heating up temporarily stuns me into silence i mean yes of course i wish i could spend twentyfour hours a day with lily i mean who wouldnt but how can i possibly

    i get a lightningquick flashback to the first year she was born when somehow i seemed to manage just fine got to spend whole weekends with her even managed to get home relatively early most nights i can do this i thought i can have the best of both worlds i can be superwoman i had my whole worklife balance sussed back then and can honestly say it was the happiest time of my life by far

    but then the recession hit hard and the staff cutbacks started and that was the end of that suddenly i was expected to do the work of three people for the same money or else get out that was it well it was worse than sophies bleeding choice because much as i love and adore the ground lily walks on work is a hugely important part of my life too and if these are my new working hours then bar resigning theres not a whole lot i can do about it

    in brutal moments of introspection i just know im someone whod go off her head in less than a week without a fulltime career to nourish my soul sure parenthood is a huge high but then so is my job peppa pig and barney videos could never possibly give me the same buzz so if its not too much to ask cant i just have both i mean plenty of other women do dont they

    but i have at least established clear boundaries with the office and made it perfectly clear to everyone that my sundays with lily are sacrosanct the one day out of an otherwise mental week when i get to read her stories and make pancakes with her then maybe take her to a disney movie or else to feed the ducks in the park you know spoil her rotten be a proper mummy

    mind you ever since the most recent staff culling started i reluctantly have to admit that elka might have a point and that even sacred sunday mummy time seems to have been seriously curtailed lately last week for instance id made lily her breakfast played imaginary tea parties with her small army of dolls and was just about to take her to the toystore for a very special treat when i got a call to get into the office asap there was an emergency news conference about a breaking story developing in afghanistan so what else could i do i had to be there simple as that goes with the job

    and i may not let it show but i love my little lily so much that it physically aches to be away from her for any length of time never mind for the eighteenhour days im practically expected to put in right now for gods sake dont i have enough guilt of my own to deal with at being apart from her without having it flung into my face by someone who im employing and at premium rates too i might add

    tell you what i have a suggestion elka i say evenly and deliberately locking my voice into its lowest register which ive learned is absolutely the best way to deal with any confrontational situation and i should know having been through more than a fair few in my time is it too much to ask that you just get on with your job let me get on with mine and then this evening when im home from work we can discuss this calmly at a more appropriate time come on now what do you say to that
    but madams in no mood to listen to reason

    i say to all the other nannies you have no husband you have no boyfriend no man instead you are married to your work

    and  bam

    excuse me what did you just say

     all other children i know each has each mother and father but not lily she only have mother so the mother need to be here for her more much much more

    okay now that feels exactly the same as a hard wallop across the cheek and hurts so much it momentarily stuns me so of course the second i come to i snap right back at her the way i seem to snap at everyone these days but there you go thats what deep ongoing exhaustion and offthescale stress levels will do to you

    elka i made it perfectly clear to you from day one that i was a single parent i tell her crisply i dont have a problem with it and neither does lily but if this is some kind of issue for you you really should have said so before now

    single parent need to spend more time with kids not less

    okay so now im fuming feeling like smoke is physically puffing out of my ears cartoonlike because shes hit my weak spot squareon with all the accuracy of an aircraft bomber yes im a lone parent and yes there can be huge disadvantages to that but deal with it is my attitude

    the subject of lilys father is one thats not up for discussion not now not ever

    and when i think of the amount of money i pay elka every month  and all for what so she can stand here pass judgement on my life and make me feel about two inches tall so she can spend all day playing with a little girl whos not even three years old does she think that i wouldnt jump at the chance to stay home all day and be a fulltime mum doesnt she realise how its like a stab in the chest every time i have to kiss lilys little strawberryblonde head of curls goodbye or worst of all when i have to listen to the innumerable voice messages she leaves on my phone when im at work in her angelic little baby voice all with the same unvarying theme i miss you mama when are you coming home there are times when all i want to do is hug her and hold her and tell her not to bother growing up its not worth all the hassle just stay like this stay my little girl forever

    doesnt anyone realise how gutted i am that i seem to be missing out on so much of her missed her taking her first baby steps missed her saying her first words  im never there im either in a meeting or writing an editorial or chairing a news conference always always working and of course i went into single parenthood with both eyes open i knew massive life changes would be involved which is why i hired a livein nanny plus two backup childminders in case of emergencies hired them  and then subsequently had to accept all their resignations one by one like ducks in a row for exactly the same reasons elka is now citing

    but come on in my defence how was i supposed to know with all the redundancies at work in the past two years that my workload would effectively double anyway i think furious with exhaustion now what does elka think im putting in all these ungodly hours for anyway only to keep myself sane while giving my little girl the best life that i possibly can hardly my fault that i cant be in two places at once  not with the hours im expected to put in and certainly not with my contract up for renewal in six months not now apart from everything else i have to worry about now theres trouble afoot at work you see though its not normally something i articulate out loud

    trouble by the name of seth coleman managing editor of the post

    ah seth coleman where do i begin he hasnt even been in the job that long he was headhunted from the sunday press when his predecessor at the post left who by the way was a gorgeous preppy easygoing guy i strongly suspect i drove out of there and who i now miss more than my right hand his official reason for quitting was for worklife balance and to be perfectly honest who could blame him

    anyway when pressed officially as to my opinion of seth i smile curtly and acknowledge his fine leadership qualities and firm grasp of the newspaper business always adding that hes never anything else than a consummate professional at all times always

    but when im standing in the shower which is about the only place i get any kind of private time to myself these days i will namecall seth coleman as the sleaziest most hypocritical blocks on the face of the planet with a thin slimy greasy head of hair and pockmarked boiledred skin whose total absence of neck gives him more than a passing resemblance to barney rubble oh and with an ego the approximate size of saturns fiftyseven moons represents just about every trait that i despise in the male sex and even manages to discover a few new ones along the way patronising to my face but behind my back i know right well that hes deeply resentful of working for a woman and with my sevenyear contract up for renewal in the next few months even the dogs on the street seem to know that his greedy eye is now firmly focused on the big prize

    a classically meanspirited man hes also someone who keeps a mental tally of all my losses in work diligently measuring all my shortcomings rather than any of my gains for starters hes been busily spreading rumour after rumour about me and theyve all filtered back that im slipping that ever since i had lily im not the firebrand i once was that im not living and breathing the job like i used to and i know just know without being told that hes just biding his time waiting for me to crack and so therefore i cant

    so i do what i have to do go into work and act the part of the bossiest boss that the world of big bossy business could ask for do exactly what im programmed to do and its tough and getting tougher by the day even though my job defines me its who i am and not for one second could i consider doing something less stressful

    but having said all that the brightest part of my day isnt when i sign off on the next issue of the post its seeing the little strawberryblonde head of an almostthreeyearold sleeping like an angel when i get home cuddled up in her bed with her favourite teddy bear beside her and ill gaze at her adorably freckled pink little angels face and whisper to her that i love her so so much and that one day well have proper time to be together

    then i do what i always do collapse into bed and try to lock away the guilt that feels like heartburn every time i realise the one single thing that has the power to kill me on the inside the only time i seem to see my baby girl these days is when shes sleeping

    but back to elka still spitting fire and venom at me on the upstairs landing

    lily is beautiful little girl she spews and i will be sad to say goodbye to her but the hours you make me work are crazy crazy and they making me crazy too

    really sorry about this im forced to interrupt unable to take much more but im going to be late for work could we please discuss this later

    i not finished i know my entitlements too my other friends tell me you must give me p45 with full salary entitlements paid up front before i leave

    interesting i think wryly grabbing my car keys elkas grasp of english is so weak she can barely get by in the supermarket and yet her vocabulary freely encompasses quite scarily impressive phrases like p45 with full salary entitlements paid up front

    elka i tell her as briskly as i can given that im now running so late it doesnt bear thinking about

    can i just point out that its not as if you have to take care of lily all day every day shes only just started in preschool and is there till early afternoon every day which gives you a good fivehour break plus its not like youre expected to do housework on top of everything else ive a cleaning lady a gardener and a handyman who between them pretty much do everything that needs doing around here so youll forgive me for thinking that you actually have it pretty easy compared to some

    like oooh  me for starters

    but the snarling harridan stands firm arms folded eyes slitted ponytail swished defiantly back over her shoulders

    you not listening to me i am handing you in my notice and i want to be gone by the end of the week im veeeery sorry but thats final

    its all i can do to nod curtly resisting the temptation to wham the hall door behind me and get into my car as calmly as i can above all trying not to let her see how much shes knocked me for six

    stopped at traffic lights on leeson st on the way to work i have to pull the car over when i realise that out of nowhere theres a hot hole in the pit of my stomach and suddenly i have an urgent need to cry and now here it comes my daily anxiety attack  jeez i could nearly set a clock by its arrival so out they come messy uncontrollable dry hiccupping tears of frustration and tiredness that i never allow myself born from not having paused for breath in  oh  about seven years now cant help it its like my heart is aching with a pain thats completely indescribable

    christ alive not even six am in the shagging morning and already im filled with a darkness thats almost unbearable at the thoughts of the day ahead to my knowledge ive never actually had a heart attack but i swear it couldnt possibly feel much worse than this

    because i have never felt so torn in my whole life not just between work and home that i could deal with that wouldnt be a problem trouble is my job isnt just one big job its also about nine hundred and ninetynine small jobs that go with the one big job so instead of feeling pulled in two directions im being pulled in around a thousand and frankly there are times when i just dont know how much longer this can continue

    oh what the hell is wrong with me i say aloud starting to get panicky as i fish round the bottom of my handbag for a kleenex can this really be me eloise elliot acting like such a complete milksop time was when i would work this exact same schedule and it barely knocked a feather out of me time was if i happened to drive past a woman on her own sobbing her heart out in a parked car at dawn id look at her pityingly and assume she was having some kind of breakdown and clearly needed professional help time was when i used to think that id somehow been born without tear ducts

    but that girl only existed bl  before lily  and now in her place is a shadow of the old eloise elliot a woman filled with darkness whos expected to do the work of a dozen people and never ever crack all the while eaten up with guilt like ive never known and why because a little girl whos nearly three will come home from preschool later on today full of stories and chat that her mummy will never get to hear

    and now on top of everything else im nannyless yet again

    the six am news comes on the car radio and i know this bout of unforgivable selfindulgence is over and its time to go and face into another day so i make a huge effort to compose myself knock back a large gulpful of rescue remedy an editors best friend pat a bit of concealer round my puffy redraw eyes and with shaking hands drive on im already a good fifteen minutes behind schedule so i put my foot to the floor to try and make up the time if i dared to arrive in late word would spread that something was up and rule one of survival in my job is simple never let anyone see a chink in the armour for any reason ever theyre like a pack of barracudas in my office i swear they can physically smell the fear

    calmly as i can i make a mental note to find another childcare agency and leave a voicemail message for rachel my assistant telling her to start setting up interviews as soon as she gets in easier said than done given that the last agency i went to fired me about two years ago which stung more than a bit too but i managed not to let it show you just cant in my game not for one second

    anyway by six fifteen am im racing upstairs from the underground car park of the posts offices on tara st the only bit of exercise i ever seem to have time for these days what with all the extra work that im now expected to do for pretty much the same money i was making three years ago which by the way is a fairly standard change in the newspaper industry now ever since the recession hit in a big way and our sales took a sharp decline ie yet another stressinducing source of sleepless nights if youre the editor and your contract is up for renewal later on in the financial year

    particularly if you happen to be answerable to a board of directors who are all male with a collective average age of about sixtyfive the t rexes i call them theyre like dinosaurs from a bygone era representative of a time when all you could hear in the newsroom was the furious clacking sound of clunky metal typewriters the days when senior editors swaggered in drunk after big boozy lunches where theyd all quaff cognac wining and dining advertisers on fat expense accounts then roll back to the office late in the afternoon pissed as farts and no one would so much as bat an eyelid

    a whole other age ago during the glory days of the newspaper industry and right now frankly there are times when i feel like all im doing is fighting a brave rearguard action trying to sustain what i worry is turning into more and more of a twilight industry with the internet now leading the field as the gutteriest gutter press out there more and more each day im starting to feel that my job is like trying to steer an oil tanker through a minefield and that its only a matter of time before the whole industry is declared as extinct as the dinosaur

    its as though the board of directors feel that survival is a form of success and as far as im concerned thats just not enough not in this climate their oldfashioned attitude is that the post is a bastion of tradition that holds up the sky and while that may have been the case at one time it sure as hell isnt now times have changed and we either evolve or we die simple as that

    whats worse though is that redundancy is now in the air again i can smell it sharp as you like its hanging round every office corner its in the stale recycled air were breathing and i know just know without being told that its only a matter of time before theres yet another staff culling another round of people being asked to exactly the same job except for far less money on a threeday week

    oh god i think suddenly sickened just by the very thought that i have colleagues i pass on corridors each and every day whose days here are numbered and whats worse that im the only thing standing between them and a dole queue or more precisely me and the amount of sales volume i can continue to generate for the paper they may not know it but theyre dependent on me and me alone for their job survival and the pressure is at times overwhelming

    i quicken my pace puffing and panting to make up time thinking must try harder dont know how im going to do it but im just going to have to find more hours in the day somehow because if it kills me no one is going to lose their job not on my watch not if i can help it

    oh god half of me wonders if ive got room for another stress ulcer

    my office is all the way up on the fourth floor a gorgeous airy spacious room with floortoceiling windows that look down onto all the briskness and business of tara st below me not that ive ever got a spare second to enjoy the view that is or indeed to luxuriate in the earlymorning stillness a few precious hours before the phones start hopping and things really get pressurised round here

    and every single morning of my life when i flash my pass at the security doors and stride across the main openplan office to get to my inner sanctum there waiting for me on the wall above my desk is a giant portrait of one douglas merriman our founder and first editor who by the way would have sat in the very same office now occupied by me all of a hundred and fifty years ago hes a heavily bearded geezer who looks exactly like tolstoy and when i feel those stern victorian round owl glasses glaring down at me i look back up at him thinking the same thought that i do every single day since i took this job

    bastard you never had to work in a digital age with email and mobiles to connect you to the office even on a sunday at two am did you you never had to compete with twentyfour hour news channels or try to sell papers in the middle of the worse economic slump since the great depression did you

    im just flipping open my briefcase and whipping out my initial draft of notes on todays edition always how we kick off the day round here with a thorough going over of this mornings early edition where we scored where we could have done better where theres vast room for improvement that kind of thing all department heads are required to be here for this which means about a dozen people sitting round the conference room in total ranging from political affairs to foreign to sports and culture

    next thing without even bothering to knock seth colemans lean slimy basil rathboneesque form is filling my office door looking like he always does like he was dressed by his mammy funny but for the longest time i assumed he was gay but still in the closet no straight man would ever wear trousers that sharply ironed for starters but then a few years back he made a bizarre and badly misjudged pass at me at the christmas party i remember looking at him in blank astonishment that hed somehow misread my deep loathing of him for inyourface lust and it now lives on forevermore in the comedy quadrant of my brain

    morning eloise so whats keeping you in exactly one minute youre going to be late

    like this is an episode of 24 and im jack bauer

    everyones already waiting for you in the boardroom you know he says in his nasal whine slicking his hair back even though there must be a halfpound of grease already holding it there all department heads present and correct hope theres nothing wrong with you is there not like you to sail this dangerously close to unpunctuality

    i say nothing nod curtly and smile though gritted teeth

    so have you thought any more about my offer to escort you to the directors weekend this year its just round the corner you know

    a brief unspoken thought filters between us him mentally spelling it out to me and lets face it im the best offer youre going to get

    i totally ignore it hide my annoyance behind a sheet of a4 paper then briskly brush past him ready to start the day

and just when i think things cant get possibly get any worse dadaaa they do course they do what else did i expect its already past two in the afternoon and im back in the conference room feeling like ive never left it chairing our first meeting about the mockup of tomorrows paper

    this by the way is where we sit around and thrash out the overall shape of the news what the lead item should be on the front page what stories are developing and need to be closely monitored over the next few hours what feature and opinion pieces should be placed where everyones here at my insistence the political editor foreign financial regional culture the whole lot of them all pitching their stories and vying for the maximum coverage possible with a front page slot the absolute holy grail

    ordinarily i get a huge buzz out of this meeting tempers tend to flare passions run high  something i freely encourage  and its always exhilarating to hear each editor push their stories and battle to get the maximum number of column inches allowed were a bit like a debating club minus the alcohol but bear in mind the department heads here are about as vocal argumentative and aggressive a bunch as youd care to fight in a barroom brawl on a friday night for some reason though i just dont seem to be on the ball this afternoon

    cant concentrate cant focus impossible to after whats unfolded since this day from hell began and certainly not given whats happening in my personal life outside of these four walls oh sure no doubt about it by about eight this morning i was supremely confident that id have a replacement for elka before the day was out someone far more suitable i even went so far as to think smugly someone lets just say a bit less moody and demanding who understood what it was like to work for a busy professional single parent

    by tenthirty when id clocked a look at the first few candidates for the job admittedly i was taken aback but still reasonably sure that it was just a matter of trawling through the dross before i hit on my perfect mary poppins candidate numbers one and two were just a bit of a blip no more that that just a simple matter of doing a little bit more weeding that was all with absolutely no call for panic whatsoever

    by eleven fortyfive yes okay  so the mood had shifted a bit and now i was starting to get tetchy unable to figure out why in the name of god it was so bloody difficult to fill a perfectly simple job in the throes of an economic meltdown but i still held onto a sliver of hope that so far id just been unlucky and it was simply a matter of hanging in there till the perfect nanny calmly strolled into my life to stay

    and right now at two in the afternoon after the last and final disastrous interview theres no other way to describe it im in a blind bleeding panic about a dozen voices are bickering for all theyre worth clamouring for my attention across the boardroom while i sit at the top of the table looking and acting like im listening intently but actually im a million miles away

    because now i know its finally official im on the brink of a crisis

    i have no childcare as of the end of this week i have no one to help me not a single soul and what in the name of god am i going to do then take lily into work with me and stick her into a playpen in the middle of my office hoping no one will notice yeah right some hope if i were to even think about doing that i might as well tie a large neon sign around my neck saying have finally cracked up kindly fire me asap as seth coleman is only chomping at the bit waiting to take over anyway

    the more i dwell on the problem the more my mouth begins to feel dry and although im desperately trying not to let it show i know that tiny beads of worry sweat are forming on my forehead as my heart palpitates with anxiety i hear nervous rattling and realise its my ring off the desk in front of me so i snap open a bottle of water and try to focus on the length of my inhale and exhale desperately trying to stay in the game because if i am in the throes of a fullblown panic attack no one in this room can ever know about it try as i might though the same sickening thought keeps playing like a loop in my head over and over again and theres just no getting away from it

    every available nanny out there is completely unhireable im in the middle of the biggest crisis ive had since having lily there is no one absolutely no one out there to help me and what in the name of arse am i supposed to do now

    earlier today rachel my longsuffering assistant managed to trawl through the few childcare agencies that i havent been blacklisted from as of yet and scraped together a grand total of four nannies for me to interview yes thats right four were in the middle of the deepest recession since the dark ages no one is spending a red cent property values have dropped so much that peoples homes have fallen back to the prices they would have been in viking times and above all  there are no jobs

    and yet here i am fully poised to pay top dollar plus bribe money to someone wholl take care of a child whos almost three years old and move into a perfectly comfortable home in rathgar with their own bedroom and ensuite to boot not exactly a demanding gig its not brain surgery its not like running a global corporation all im looking for is some reasonable responsible person wholl make sure a little girl eats up her vegetables gets to pre school on time takes her naps when shes supposed to and doesnt spend the entire afternoon watching cbeebies on telly  and can i find anyone to fill the vacancy no not a solitary soul

    it beggars belief three interviews in total today and each and every one has been an unmitigated disaster you want to see the standard  and i really wish i were joking but some of these people would make mel gibson look employable and so now theres no getting around it as of the end of this week when elka buggers off i cant get anyone to take care of lily for me i have no one no one

    and believe me ive done everything ive swallowed my pride and called elka offering to double her salary and negotiate more time off if shell only reconsider but no joy shes had enough of the job and wants out simple as that in desperation i even thought of calling on my sister helen but know without even bothering to ask that its not a runner

    being brutally honest i have to admit that helen and i have little in common and have never really been all that close so shes hardly someone i can expect to come to my rescue in my hour of need besides since i had lily helens gone and met a guy called darren who runs a small seaside bb in cobh and within an alarmingly short space of time she upped sticks and announced she was moving down the country to work side by side with him packed everything in for him her job in a call centre her brandnew flat the lot but then thats my sister for you shes always struck me as someone who panicdated panicsettled and is now living with the consequences  in cobh miles and miles away from her old friends and her old life

    total insanity i thought at the time and i still continue to think it and although ive only met darren a handful of times at christmas dinners or else on the rare occasions when they both come to dublin and drop in to visit me and lily i cant help wondering if helen is actually happy living with him two hundred miles away in a tiny remote village but then keeping up to date on whats happening in each others lives is tough and apart from the odd hi great to hear from you but can i call you back im running into a meeting type chat we never seem to really get a chance to catch up properly

    and no i still havent taken lily down to cobh to visit in spite of all the childs entreaties and in spite of the fact that she adores her auntie because how could i possibly leave work every now and then helen will email mainly either to vaguely moan for a little bit about darren or else in a roundabout way to ask for a lend of money it seems people in the hotel business are even more savagely affected by the economic downturn than the rest of us and i always oblige and fire off a cheque and never ask for it back and shell gratefully accept then send bright breezy emails inviting lily and me down for a freebie weekend anytime we want which is a nice thought and much appreciated but come on  me get a whole entire weekend off saturday and sunday one day after the other are you kidding me

    that aside though i know helens up to her tonsils with trying to make ends meet at the bb  la sibyl fawlty anyway so im sure shes quite enough on her plate without me landing lily on top of her too plus no matter how desperate i was and no matter how much money i paid helen to take care of her till i got sorted it would mean id never get to see my little girl at all wouldnt it and frankly the snatched glimpses of her slumbering little head first thing every morning and last thing at night are about the only thing keeping me sane after the daily grind im expected to get through the one dangling carrot in my life that somehow makes the rest of it all that bit more bearable

barack obamas reelection campaign has just got to get a page one tomorrow eloise robbie turner is thundering on interrupting my incessant stream of worrying robbie is the posts chainsmoking gravellyvoiced chief political editor a likeable guy young but never youthful looking he just streels round the office night and day looking as washed out and baggyeyed as the rest of us but then because of the time differences involved in covering any foreign story the political editor is expected to put in hours almost as ridiculous as i do myself the general rule of thumb is that if im here till the night editor takes over at eleven pm chances are ill catch a glimpse of robbies thick prematurely white shock of hair and john lennon glasses still at his desk bashing out a first draft of a story breaking in the middle east while the rest of the western world snoozes peacefully on

    so i happen to know that robbie rarely gets any time off to be with his own young and growing family and to his credit its something hes never once complained about i may not let it show but im genuinely fond of him as ive told the board of directors on many occasions robbie is someone who does consistent good work in the face of pressure that would drive a lesser personality straight to the nearest home for the bewildered

    the only slight downside in these meetings is that robbies sole weak spot tends to come to the fore his unhealthy obsession with barack obama to the point that the running joke in the office is that hes actually a tiny bit in love with him im not kidding he eats drinks sleeps and breathes barack obama and the highlight of his life to date was getting to shake the hand of the mighty one when he visited ireland true there were about four hundred other people in the room with him at the time but robbie still managed to wangle past the secret service and touch the hem of the garment of the chosen one so to speak all while making it sound like theyd shared an intimate oneonone meeting just the two of them chatting about the reelection campaign over a nice cuppa and a plate of hobnobs he even had a photo of said momentous event taken and turned it into his personalised christmas card last year

    eloise you have to listen to me robbies insisting getting redfaced now as his voice rises to be heard about the clamour he doesnt lose his cool often but when he does its almost like watching a cartoon eyes popping red veins bulging out of the side of his neck white hair nearly standing up straight on the top of his head the whole works

    this is getting to be too big a story just to tuck away on page three in world news beside david cameron making a speech about landmine victims in angola like we did yesterday he has to almost shout to be heard above the racket in the room the primaries are in full swing the election proper is only round the corner and its high time it got the front page can i remind you that its page one on every us national daily and has been for weeks now so why are we lagging behind us coverage when we need to keep pace with this story

    robbie might sound narky and aggressive but i know hes not this is just how he comes across and i know him well enough to know its not bolshiness on his part its purely because he cares so much

    sign of a good political editor

    on and on he goes enthusiastically firing off statistics about democratic versus gop expenditure on the presidents reelection to heated shouts of ahh not this again give it a rest will you from the rest of the room while a few hacks start humming a sarcastic chorus of the star spangled banner

    next thing seth coleman sits back arms folded and throws in his two cents worth

    yes were all aware theres an election coming up in the us thanks for that robbie he spits dryly with his lizardy unblinking eyes focused on me as ever your fundamental grasp of the obvious is overwhelmingly helpful can we please move on to some actual hard news

    and although im nodding giving the outward appearance of being focused and interested in the game the truth is  to my shame im actually miles away utterly and totally absorbed in my own worries i may look like im listening but all i can really hear is the sound of the blood singing in my ears as my pulse rate feels like its soaring well up into triple figures

    then dimly in the background like a kind of accompanying soundtrack to all my stressing and fretting our northern correspondent ruth oconnell manages to successfully shout robbie down take up the intellectual cudgels and is now aggressively pitching a two thousand word story on a car bomb that went off in newry last night injuring a high ranking senior sergeant in the psni

    ruths from belfast thin and wiry with severe jetblack bobbed hair and the whitest skin you ever saw which kind of gives her the look of louise brooks except with muscles even her teeth which are irregular and uneven seem to strike an attitude she wears skinny little trouser suits like theyre a uniform always in varying shades of black or grey and has exactly the same washedout blearyeyed look on her pale gaunt face as the rest of us

    ruths also a terrific subeditor feisty and like a dog with a bone when shes on the verge of a breaking story always with an uncanny sixth sense for what will be next weeks big lead on the down side though shes a bit too fond of the sound of her own strident voice and tends to try and dominate these meetings pushing her own agenda with the aggressive tactic of simply yelling down the rest of the room at the best of times im always glad to have her here because hard as it is to believe she and i are the only two women in the room but im even more so today her banging on about catholic versus protestant attitudes to joining the psni and the resultant socioeconomic effect on whole communities gives me space to think a bit more clearly about the disastrous interviews i had to suffer through earlier

    ohgodohgodohgod where do i start maybe by asking rachel if shes accidentally rung up a theatrical agency and told them i was holding open auditions for third thug from the left in some tv cop show maybe then id be able to understand the parade of headcases i had to deal with and to think that these people were actually vetted and approved by a nanny agency its just beyond comprehension

    candidate number one sauntered in earlier this morning ten minutes late and wearing a tracksuit with a tight leather jacket over it with  and i wish i were joking here  the words mega revenge written in flames across the back of it oh and if that wasnt enough she had a pierced nose and eyebrow with a black tattoo all down the side of her hand i caught a glimpse of her in the reception area outside my office and that was frankly enough the very sight of this one was enough to make my bowels wither and i knew lily would take one look at her then either start crying or else innocently ask me who was the scary lady and why did she have an earring coming out of her nose not a runner so i called rachel in and told her in no uncertain terms to get rid of her and that if she wouldnt leave then to threaten her with security

    hot on her heels was candidate number two who tiptoed pale and shaking into my office stinking of cigarette smoke no cv no experience nothing her boyfriend had just left her she immediately told me and now she not only had nowhere to live but absolutely no reason to live either so what have you been doing for the past few years i asked anxious to get off the subject of her private life ive been a patient in the john of gods she told me suffering from bipolar manic depression but according to her the good news was she was officially off suicide watch and fully prepared to mind my child for forty euro an hour i was half afraid shed throw herself out of the window if i told her there and then that she wasnt exactly what i was looking for so i gave her the more cowardly dont call me ill call you line and gently shooed her out of there asap

    this is what should be on the front page the complete and utter lack of childcare for busy working parents i find myself silently ranting while ruth thunders on now shes rolling up her sleeves  always a bad sign with her means a row is never too far off  and spouting on about a recent survey indicating the tiny minority of catholics who now are fully paidup members of the psni and the general unfairness of it all and how its setting the whole peace process back a full decade

    thats another thing about ruth shes superb at what she does but never in your life have you come across anyone carrying as many chips on their shoulders

    anyway kian osullivan sports editor former irish rugby international and something of a lust object among just about every female pa up and down the building who i happened to know have collectively nicknamed him don draper playfully fires a rolledup ball of paper over at her then in no uncertain terms he tells her to shut up and demands to know why sports always gets considered last on anyones list of priorities when were blocking out tomorrows paper

    because people only really care about sports results on a sunday after all the saturday games you gobshite growls robbie in his twentyfagsaday voice but coming from him that could be deemed a term of affection

    seriously eloise you have got to listen to me on this ruth is almost screeching to be heard over the racket waving a fistful of notes in front of her like thats going to catch my attention its front page stuff and if we dont run with it make no mistake the chronicle will and then itll be my head on the block wont it on and on she spews thumping her fist off the table in angry frustration now

    meanwhile out of the corner of my eye im dimly aware of everyone looking to me waiting on me to call the lot of them to order like some overly strict school headmistress whose class has sensed that shes a bit distracted and is now all acting up accordingly
    eloise says seth coleman fro
m directly across the table delatticing his fingers slicking back the lank greasy hair and giving me one of his unblinking lizardlike stares very disconcerting if youre not used to him we really do need to wrap this up tempus fugit

    i hide my irritation and point out that we havent heard from our finance editor yet throwing the floor open to jack dundon a bespectacled greyhaired greyskinned softly spoken guy with a background as an awardwinning economist someone who rarely shines at these meetings but wholl consistently come up trumps and turn out impeccably researched stories written in language readers can grasp unlike those on some of our rivals finance pages that youd nearly need a harvard masters in finance to get your head around

    he draws the air of experience deep into his lungs and addresses the now silent room the european central bank have announced an interest rate hike of half a per cent is his calm opener which mightnt exactly be the sexiest lead story at the table but itll affect hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders and so therefore it has massive bite on and on he goes giving me the freedom to let my thoughts take me back to my more pressing concerns and back to about noon today when in sauntered a slightly more promising candidate for the job of nannylifesaver

    but when i say slightly more promising all i mean is she was young reasonably well groomed and at least had the courtesy to turn up for the interview appropriately dressed even if her eye makeup did happen to be the exact colour of bright yellow hazardous waste trouble was she had precious little experience in childcare and when i asked her why her cv only had one reference on it her answer was that she was really an outofwork actress and thought this would be a nice little earner until her big break arrived

    i mean its only minding a kid isnt it besides ive loads of nieces and nephews and i know im well able to handle it she coolly informs me and the reference i have is good my auntie went to load of trouble to write it for me oh but by the way she added hammering a further nail into her own coffin if my agent rings about an audition then ill need time off plus i dont work evenings after seven pm or weekends and i should probably tell you that i already have my holidays booked for the first two weeks in june im going to spain with my boyfriend so thats out as well i assume thats all ok with you

    its not often im at a loss for words but on this occasion i was i didnt answer couldnt just sat there staring at her in disbelief thinking next

    and the piece de resistance just after lunch which in my case is rarely more than a cereal bar wolfed down at my desk between phone calls and thats if im very lucky rachel buzzes into my office to say the final candidate the agency have available to start work is now waiting patiently at reception i stride out of my office to greet her praying just praying that this one will look not unlike julie andrews in mary poppins act like a firm but kindly angela lansbury in bedknobs and broomsticks and keep perfect law and order in my house when im not there as strictly as emma thompson in nanny mcphee

    initial reaction was positive and for once my stomach didnt sink at the sight of what was waiting beside rachels desk for me mrs adele patterson was sixtysomething with a grey perm so tight it looked like someone had accidentally poured a tin of baked beans over her head wearing a coat that looked like it was made out of the same upholstery they use on bus seats and laden down with two marks and spencers grocery bags but she was the only candidate who actually looked like an actual proper nanny wise and calm and experienced someone youd unhesitatingly trust your child with plus she at least looked me unflinchingly straight in the eye doing me the courtesy of coming straight to the point

    i dont work in other peoples houses she told me straight up in a nononsense style that i at least respected even if what shed just said made me break out in an anxiety sweat youre welcome to leave your daughter lily isnt it well you can drop her to my house at nine in the morning no earlier and im strict about collection time too no later than six oclock in the evening please thats quite a long enough day for any child believe me and for me too i might add im not getting any younger you know

    mrs patterson im afraid  well the thing is thats going to be a problem what i need you see is  well lets just say that there might be the odd evening  just the occasional one thats all  when i could possibly get delayed getting home from work so i really am looking for someone whos prepared to live in at my house which is very comfortable by the way  its in rathgar i tack on hopefully like thisll make a difference

    makes no difference to me if you live in the penthouse suite of the four seasons love she snapped back sounding shellshocked at the very suggestion and getting pinker in the face by the minute

    well i would be paying premium rates of course and we can always negotiate a day off for you  i exaggerated astonished at the sheer brazenness of my lie

    day off i think elka got one day off in the past year and that was on christmas day and even at that she still had to take lily for a few hours in the afternoon while i dashed into the office to check the layout for the stephens day edition of the post

    but my back is to the wall here and short of mrs patterson producing references that implicate her in the massacre of a school full of small children shes hired

    then im very sorry to waste your time miss elliot but im afraid this is just not going to work out simple as that you see i take care of my two grandchildren at home as well so either your little girl can stay with me daytimes only with collection strictly no later than six pm or thats it im not here to bargain with you or to offer you any other alternative and whats more im going to have to leave now as it is i had to ask a neighbour to look after the other children for me so i could get into town to meet you

    ok it was at this point that i got desperate not even able to conceal the pleading in my tone this woman was my last hope and i couldnt just couldnt let her walk out the door

    mrs patterson as you can see my job here doesnt exactly allow me to work regular nine to five hours but if youll just hear me out about moving into my home only for a short time you understand id be happy to pay you far far more than the agency rates

    i look at her pleadingly silently begging her to say yes

    lilys such a good girl i tack on for good measure shes very well behaved everyone says so and minding her really is a doddle 

    its a no im afraid mrs patterson replied crisply theres no way that id just abandon my own husband and grandchildren to move into a strangers house no matter what you paid me you must understand that there are some things in life that are far far more important than any job or any amount of money like family for one she said looking pointedly at me

    then picking up her handbag and groceries and tossing me a curt nod she showed herself out of my office and back towards reception leaving me feeling like id just been cut and dried and left to hang out for dead on a line

    back to the meeting and it seems seth coleman with his barracudalike instincts is onto me

    earth to eloise are you with us or what he says rapping a pen with bony fingers impatiently off a pile of folders in front of him we really need to move on this some of us have work to do you know

    im suddenly aware that all eyes are locked on me and that im in danger of losing control of the room its gone quiet scarily quiet people are coughing and looking in my direction anxious to get out of here which means its now over to me and im going to have to make it at least look like im on the ball

    fine thank you seth i manage to say crisply as i can in that case the mockup of tomorrows front page is this firstly we lead with the ecb interest rate hike

    cut to groans and moans from the rest of the table which i have no choice but to swat aside

    jack youre on the story and ill need hard copy on my desk by four pm at the latest second lead is northern ruth but no more than five hundred words on page one with an opinion piece in domestic on page four

    page four that is so unfair ruth yells disappointedly but again i override her

    sorry but in this gig you learn very quickly how to prioritise

    as for the us primaries theyll stay in foreign on pages four and five until one month before the election proper and thats final i say to frosty looks from robbie turner which i instantly tune out

    this story may be front page in the states robbie but were not living in washington now are we the lead us story we go with on page three is obamas statement that hes not ruling out seeking to overthrow rebels in afghanistan in spite of the phased withdrawal theres a press conference on the situation from the white house at five oclock eastern time which is going to mean a late night for you robbie thatll be eleven tonight our time and ill need full copy for the night editor before the late edition hits the presses

    a deep heartfelt sigh from robbie whos worked late pretty much every night for the past few months and who has probably forgotten what his kids even look like by now i feel a sudden flash of sympathy at the sight of his exhausted washedout face but i rise above it and move on because i have to yes i know he never gets to see his kids but then i never get to see lily either do i and its not like im asking him to do anything im not doing myself

    so on i steamroll undeterred

    also make a note that i want an opinion piece on irish life and permanent and how it may be sold off as a result of bank stress tests seth get miriam douglas onto it seven hundred words regional i want to lead with that car crash in kerry that killed three kids over the weekend plus photos too find out their ages talk to the school friends and if you can get the families to talk too thats our big human interest story and i want it to be gutwrenching also i need six hundred words on the search for those two missing teenagers latest updates in one hour please we need recent photos of both of them get derek maguire onto it right away theres a press release on its way here and as soon as it lands i want to see it courts page i want three hundred words on how in the name of god a convicted drug dealer got out on appeal yesterday no photos of him looking shifty with a hood over his head though too clichd to similar to what the independent will run with so get me a better shot than that world news we open with japan scrapping four of its stricken reactors and follow up with an update on the greek situation six hundred words each photos for both quarter page but i want to see the proofs first so seth you need to tell the picture desk thats nonnegotiable mockups no later than four pm sharp and thank you all for your time

and there it is the old familiar buzz i get from doing what i do best     feeding me like an adrenaline rush

    filthy looks all round at me but there you go sometimes you need to have a spine of steel in this job

    class dismissed and onto the next problem

its coming up to three oclock in the afternoon and as usual im multitasking or tripletasking to be more precise im in my office checking through the rough drafts of tomorrows advertising pages while at the same time trying to type out a rough draft for tomorrows editorial both of which i might add are now well behind schedule and on top of all that im simultaneously holding a meeting with marc robinson editor of the papers arts and culture section a magazineformatted supplement which comes with our saturday issue but which is put to bed the previous monday which is today which is why marc is in my office now arguing and bickering with me the way absolutely everyone seems to argue and bicker with me these days

    im really putting my foot down on this eloise hes saying pacing up and down while throwing me the odd scorching look for added dramatic effect you have to trust me i absolutely categorically refuse to give the culture cover to a kids disney movie  not when wim wenders has a new arthouse film out it insults our reader and its just  just plain degrading may i remind you its called the culture section not the commercial section you know were trying to be outthere and edgy and that bloody kids film has all the cutting edge appeal of  of val doonican sitting in his rocking chair and wearing a woolly jumper

    marc as you see is a passionate movie lover in his early thirties and even manages to look exactly like a european arthouse director should with a clever lugubrious face eccentric hair and lets just say difficult glasses its also received wisdom round here that hes official holder of the title dossiest job ever hes forever annoying everyone else by pootling off to arthouse cinemas in the middle of the day to review obscure subtitled films badly dubbed from finnish then writing three page dossiers on directors ive never heard of which its my job to then edit down and try to make a bit more lets just say readerfriendly

    i on the other hand am in a constant pushpull battle with him to reflect cultural choices that our readers might perish the thought have actually heard of basically thats anathema to someone like marc who considers a movie seen by more than a dozen people to be an overhyped commercialised hollywood sellout but then marc is someone who regularly claims that paul mccartneys maxwells silver hammer is the greatest offence ever perpetrated on mankind in the history of the planet even worse than cromwell

    too bad marc i tell him firmly while at the same time tapping out an editorial about the health service on the computer screen in front of me its coming up to the easter holidays parents with kids need to know what family movies are opening and the disney pixar one will be a blockbuster sorry but youll have to swallow your arthouse pride and just get commercial once in a while

    eloise please dont take this personally but what in the name of god would you know about culture you never go out anywhere

    i look up at him in dull surprise its not often anyone makes comments about my private life and even though its true i dont particularly like hearing it mind you marc and i go back a long way  we were at college together  so in his defence he knows he has the liberty to use that kind of shorthand with me

    what he doesnt know though is that the board of directors is seriously concerned at the overheads his department are running and that when the axe falls which it inevitably will mark my words the culture section is certain to be in line for a good pruning and marc whos been here as long as i have and whos being paid what management consider a highly inflated salary could well be first for the chop

    marcs a good writer ive pleaded with them in the past with a large and evergrowing cult following readers buy our saturday edition just to read his columns and reviews which frankly is the main reason hes lasted as long as he has in the job but the hard cold reality is that unless he wises up and stops being such a cultural snob he could well be in trouble

    and so the only reason im being as hard on him as i am is because i just dont want him to lose his gig not on my watch

    oh i support the arts alright i smile quickly back at him ill write the cheques i just havent time to see anything and just on a point of order you try sneaking off to a movie at the weekends in my job and then see how fast youre propelled to the back of a dole queue disney gets the cover marc and thats final

    then out of the blue my internal phone rings sending an icecold chill right up my spinal cord never ever a good sign i tell marc i have to take it and he skulks off knowing hes been beaten this time

    okay the internal phone ringing usually only means one thing

    oh christ alive no please dont let this be happening  not today

    but no two ways about it the nightmare is real the chairmans assistant is on the phone summoning me upstairs to a meeting of the board of directors  the t rexes  right this minute this rarely happens on the spur of the moment like this and it doesnt take einstein to figure out why theyve convened this meeting at such short notice

    the online issue of the post cant possibly be anything else i know its a matter of huge concern for the board and the last time i bumped into sir gavin hume our esteemed chairman since the year dot he as good as told me it was a matter requiring their immediate attention that its costing too much and is effectively losing readers and heres me in a severely weakened position because it was my brainchild and ive effectively staked my reputation on it so i whip out a bulging file of notes ive been working on about the online edition and mentally steel myself for the grilling that lies ahead

    anyway im just clicketyclacking out of my office to get the lift to the boardroom on the top floor when rachel my assistant stops me in my tracks

    eloise she says standing up behind her desk and looking petrified thank god i caught you theres a phone call for you and its urgent

    odd it strikes me rachel looking so terrified about whoevers on the phone mainly because every single phone call that comes for me is urgent theres always some emergency frankly the day that someone leaves a message for me saying oh tell her its not that important no rush at all in getting back to me is the day hell will freeze over

    plus rachel is normally the epitome of glacial blonde coolness under pressure which is not only why i hired her but its the main reason why shes survived so many staff cullings round here shes around my own age and the human equivalent of half a xanax tablet always chilled always in control never loses her head in short the perfect assistant for someone like me

    but right now shes thrusting a phone at me looking ghostly pale ashenfaced and like she needs to be treated for deep shock

    trust me you need to take this call

    im on my way to the boardroom i almost hiss at her impatiently not meaning to be rude but come on  surely rachel of all people knows that when the board of directors calls you drop everything and go running

    its nonnegotiable

    im sorry rachel but youll just have to tell whoevers on the phone that theyll have to wait till i call them back

    eloise you have to listen to me please try to stay calm but  its about your little girlembed"

in the present chapter we have not only a striking proof of shakespeare's minute acquaintance with natural history but of his remarkable versatility as a writer whilst displaying a most extensive knowledge of ornithology he has further illustrated his subject by alluding to those numerous legends popular sayings and superstitions which have in this and other countries clustered round the feathered race indeed the following pages are alone sufficient to show if it were necessary how fully he appreciated every branch of antiquarian lore and what a diligent student he must have been in the pursuit of that wide range of information the possession of which has made him one of the most manysided writers that the world has ever seen the numerous incidental allusions too by shakspeare to the folklore of bygone days whilst showing how deeply he must have read and gathered knowledge from every available source serve as an additional proof of his retentive memory and marvellous power of embellishing his ideas by the most apposite illustrations unfortunately however these have hitherto been frequently lost sight of through the reader's unacquaintance with that extensive field of folklore which was so well known to the poet for the sake of easy reference the birds with which the present chapter deals are arranged alphabetically

barnaclegoosethere was a curious notion very prevalent in former times that this bird anser bernicla was generated from the barnacle leilas anatifera a shellfish growing on a flexible stem and adhering to loose timber bottoms of ships c a metamorphosis to which shakspeare alludes in the tempest iv i where he makes caliban say

we shall lose our time and all be turnd to barnacles

this vulgar error no doubt originated in mistaking the fleshy peduncle of the shellfish for the neck of a goose the shell for its head and the tentacula for a tuft of feathers these shellfish therefore bearing as seen out of the water a resemblance to the goose's neck were ignorantly and without investigation confounded with geese themselves in france the barnaclegoose may be eaten on fast days by virtue of this old belief in its fishy origin like other fictions this one had its variations for sometimes the barnacles were supposed to grow on trees and thence to drop into the sea and become geese as in drayton's account of furness polyolb 1622 song 27 p 1190 as early as the 12th century this idea was promulgated by giraldus cambrensis in his topographia hiberni gerarde who in the year 1597 published his herball or generall historie of plantes narrates the followingthere are found in the north parts of scotland and the isles adjacent called orcades certain trees whereon do grow certain shellfishes of a white colour tending to russet wherein are contained little living creatures which shells in time of maturity do open and out of them grow those little living things which falling into the water do become fowls whom we call barnacles in the north of england brant geese and in lancashire tree geese but the others that do fall upon the land perish and do come to nothing thus much of the writings of others and also
from the mouths of people of those parts which may very well accord with truth but what our eyes have seen and hands have touched we shall declare there is a small island in lancashire called the pile of foulders wherein are found the broken pieces of old ships some whereof have been cast thither by shipwreck and also the trunks or bodies with the branches of old rotten trees cast up there likewise whereon is found a certain spume or froth that in time breedeth into certain shells in shape like those of the mussel but sharper pointed and of a whitish colour wherein is contained a thing in form like a lace of silk one end whereof is fastened unto the inside of the shell even as the fish of oysters and mussels are the other end is made fast unto the belly of a rude mass or lump which in time cometh to the shape and form of a bird when it is perfectly formed the shell gapeth open and the first thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or string next come the legs of the bird hanging out and as it groweth greater it openeth the shell by degrees till at length it is all come forth and hangeth only by the bill in short space after it cometh to full maturity and falleth into the sea where it gathereth feathers and groweth to a fowl bigger than a mallard and lesser than a goose having black legs and bill or beak and feathers black and white spotted in such a manner as is our magpie which the people of lancashire call by no other name than a tree goose an interesting cut of these birds so growing is given by mr halliwellphillipps from a manuscript of the 14th century who is of opinion that the barnacle mentioned by caliban was the treegoose it is not to be supposed however that there were none who doubted this marvellous story or who took steps to refute it belon so long ago as 1551 says mr harting and others after him treated it with ridicule and a refutation may be found in willughby's ornithology which was edited by ray in 1678 this vulgar error is mentioned by many of the old writers thus bishop hall in his virgidemiarum lib iv sat 2 says

the scottish barnacle if i might choose
that of a worme doth waxe a winged goose

butler too in his hudibras iii ii 1 655 speaks of it and marston in his malecontent 1604 has the followinglike your scotch barnacle now a block instantly a worm and presently a great goose

blackbirdthis favourite is called in the midsummer night's dream iii 1 an ousel old french oisel a term still used in the neighbourhood of leeds

the ousel cock so black of hue
with orange tawny bill

in the 2d part of king henry iv iii 2 when justice shallow inquires of justice silence and how doth my cousin he is answered
alas a black ousel cousin shallow a phrase which no doubt corresponded to our modern one a black sheep in spenser's epithalamium 1 82 the word occurs

the ousel shrills the ruddock warbles soft

buzzardmr staunton suggests that in the following passage of the taming of the shrew ii 1 a play is intended upon the words and that in the second line buzzard means a beetle from its peculiar buzzing noise

o slowwingd turtle shall a buzzard take thee
ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard

the beetle was formerly called a buzzard and in staffordshire a cockchafer is termed a humbuz in northamptonshire we find a proverb i'm between a hawk and a buzzard which means i don't know what to do or how to act

chaffinchsome think that this bird is alluded to in the song in the midsummer night's dream iii 1 where the expression finch is used the chaffinch having always been a favourite cage bird with the lowerclasses in troilus and cressida v 1 thersites calls patroclus a finchegg which was evidently meant as a term of reproach others again consider the phrase is equivalent to coxcomb

choughin using this word shakespeare probably in most cases meant the jackdaw for in a midsummer night's dream iii 2 he says

russetpated choughs many in sort
rising and cawing at the gun's report

the term russetpated being applicable to the jackdaw but not to the real chough in 1 henry iv v 1 prince henry calls falstaff chewetpeace chewet peacein allusion no doubt to the chough or jackdaw for common birds have always had a variety of names  such an appellation would be a proper reproach to falstaff for his meddling and impertinent talk steevens and malone however finding that chewets were little round pies made of minced meat thought that the prince compared falstaff for his unseasonable chattering to a minced pie cotgrave  describes the french chouette as an owlet also a chough which many consider to be the simple and satisfactory explanation of chewet belon in his history of birds paris 1855 speaks of the chouette as the smallest kind of chough or crow again in 1 henry iv ii 2 in the amusing scene where falstaff with the prince and poins meet to rob the travellers at gadshill falstaff calls the victims fat chuffs probably says mr harting who connects the word with chough from their strutting about with much noise nares too in his explanation of chuff says that some suppose it to be from chough which is similarly pronounced and means a kind of seabird generally esteemed a stupid one various other meanings are given thus mr gifford affirms that chuff is always used in a bad sense and means a coarse unmannered clown at once sordid and wealthy and mr halliwellphillipps explains it as spoken in contempt for a fat person in northamptonshire we find the word chuff used to denote a person in good condition as in clare's village minstrel

his chuff cheeks dimpling in a fondling smile

shakespeare alludes to the practice of teaching choughs to talk although from the following passages he does not appear to have esteemed their talking powers of much value for in all's well that ends well iv 1 he says

choughs language gabble enough and good enough
and in tempest ii 1 he represents antonio as saying
there be that can rule naples
as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
as amply and unnecessarily
as this gonzalo i myself could make
a chough of as deep chat

shakespeare always refers to the jackdaw as the daw the chough or jackdaw was one of the birds considered ominous by our forefathers an allusion to which occurs in macbeth iii 4

augurs and understood relations have
by magotpies and choughs and rooks brought forth
the secretst man of blood

at the present day this bird is not without its folklore and there is a norwich rhyme to the following effect 

when three daws are seen on st peter's vane together
then we're sure to have bad weather

in the north too of england the flight of jackdaws down the chimney is held to presage death

cockthe beautiful notion which represents the cock as crowing all night long on christmas eve and by its vigilance dispelling every kind of malignant spirit and evil influence is graphically mentioned in hamlet i 1 where marcellus speaking of the ghost says

it faded on the crowing of the cock
some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
wherein our saviour's birth is celebrated
the bird of dawning singeth all night long
and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad
the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
so hallowd and so gracious is the time
in short there is a complete prostration of the powers of darkness and thus for the time being mankind is said to be released from the influence of all those evil forces which otherwise exert such sway the notion that spirits fly at cockcrow is very ancient and is mentioned by the christian poet prudentius who flourished in the beginning of the fourth century there is also a hymn said to have been composed by st ambrose and formerly used in the salisbury service which so much resembles the following speech of horatio i 1 that one might almost suppose shakespeare had seen it 

the cock that is the trumpet to the morn
doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat
awake the god of day and at his warning
whether in sea or fire in earth or air
the extravagant and erring spirit hies
to his confine

this disappearance of spirits at cockcrow is further alluded to i 2

the morning cock crew loud
and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
and vanishd from our sight

blair too in his grave has these graphic words

the tale
of horrid apparition tall and ghastly
that walks at dead of night or takes his stand
oer some newopend grave and strange to tell
evanishes at crowing of the cock

this superstition has not entirely died out in england and a correspondent of notes and queries relates an amusing legend current in devonshiremr n was a squire who had been so unfortunate as to sell his soul to the devil with the condition that after his funeral the fiend should take possession of his skin he had also persuaded a neighbour to be present on the occasion of the flaying on the death of mr n this man went in a state of great alarm to the parson of the parish and asked his advice by him he was told to fulfil his engagement but he must be sure and carry a cock into the church with him on the night after the funeral the man proceeded to the church armed with the cock and as an additional security took up his position in the parson's pew at twelve o'clock the devil arrived opened the grave took the corpse from the coffin and flayed it when the operation was concluded he held the skin up before him and remarked 'well twas not worth coming for after all for it is all full of holes' as he said this the cock crew whereupon the fiend turning round to the man exclaimed 'if it had not been for the bird you have got there under your arm i would have your skin too' but thanks to the cock the man got home safe again various origins have been assigned to this superstition which hampson 2 regards as a misunderstood tradition of some saban fable the cock he adds which seems by its early voice to call forth the sun was esteemed a sacred solar bird hence it was also sacred to mercury one of the personifications of the sun

a very general amusement up to the end of the last century was cockfighting a diversion of which mention is occasionally made by shakespeare as in antony and cleopatra ii 3

his cocks do win the battle still of mine
when it is all to nought

and again hamlet says v 2

o i die horatio
the potent poison quite oercrows my spirit

meaning the poison triumphs over him as a cock over his beaten antagonist formerly cockfighting entered into the occupations of the old and young schools had their cockfights travellers agreed with coachmen that they were to wait a night if there was a cockfight in any town through which they passed when country gentlemen had sat long at table and the conversation had turned upon the relative merits of their several birds a cockfight often resulted as the birds in question were brought for the purpose into the diningroom cockfighting was practised on shrove tuesday to a great extent and in the time of henry vii seems to have been practised within the precincts of court the earliest mention of this pastime in england is by fitzstephens in 1191 happily nowadays cockfighting is by law a misdemeanour and punishable by penalty one of the popular terms for a cock beaten in a fight was a craven to which we find a reference in the taming of the shrew ii 1no cock of mine you crow too like a craven we may also compare the expression in henry v iv 7he is a craven and a villain else in the old appeal or wager of battle in our common law we are told on the authority of lord coke that the party who confessed himself wrong or refused to fight was to pronounce the word cravent and judgment was at once given against him singer 3 says the term may be satisfactorily traced from crant crant the old french word for an act of submission it is so written in the old metrical romance of ywaine and gawaine ritson i 133

or yelde the til us als creant
and in richard coeur de lion weber ii 208

on knees he fel down and cryde craunt
it then became cravant cravent and at length craven


in the time of shakespeare the word cock was used as a vulgar corruption or purposed disguise of the name of god an instance of which occurs in hamlet iv 5by cock they are to blame this irreverent alteration of the sacred name is found at least a dozen times in heywood's edward the fourth where one passage is

heraldsweare on this booke king lewis so help you god
you mean no otherwise then you have said
king lewisso helpe me cock as i dissemble not

we find too other allusions to the sacred name as in cock'spassion cock'sbody as in taming of the shrew iv icock's passion silence a not uncommon oath too in shakespeare's time was cock and piecock referring to god and pie being supposed to mean the servicebook of the romish church a meaning which says mr dyce seems much more probable than douce's supposition that this oath was connected with the making of solemn vows by knights in the days of chivalry during entertainments at which a roasted peacock was served up it is used by justice shallow 2 henry iv v 1by cock and pye sir you shall not away tonight we may also compare the expression in the old play of soliman and perseda 1599by cock and pye and mousefoot mr harting  says the cock and pye ie magpie was an ordinary alehouse sign and may have thus become a subject for the vulgar to swear by

the phrase cockahoop which occurs in romeo and juliet i 5

you'll make a mutiny among my guests
you will set cockahoop you'll be the man

no doubt refers to a reckless person who takes the cock or tap out of a cask and lays it on the top or hoop of the barrel thus letting all the contents of the cask run out formerly a quart pot was called a hoop being formed of staves bound together with hoops like barrels there were generally three hoops to such a pot hence in 2 henry vi iv 2 one of jack cade's popular reformations was to increase their number the threehooped pot shall have ten hoops and i will make it felony to drink small beer some however consider the term cockahoop  refers to the boastful crowing of the cock

in king lear iii 2 shakespeare speaks of the cataracts and hurricanoes as having

drenched our steeples drowned the cocks

vanes on the tops of steeples were in days gone by made in the form of a cockhence weathercocksand put up in papal times to remind the clergy of watchfulness apart too from symbolism the large tail of the cock was well adapted to turn with the wind

cormorantthe proverbial voracity of this bird gave rise to a man of large appetite being likened to it a sense in which shakespeare employs the word as in coriolanus i 1the cormorant belly in love's labour's lost i 1cormorant devouring time and in troilus and cressida ii 2this cormorant war although says mr harting  shakespeare mentions the cormorant in several of his plays he has nowhere alluded to the sport of using these birds when trained for fishing a fact which is singular since he often speaks of the then popular pastime of hawking and he did not die until some years after james i had made fishing with cormorants a fashionable amusement

crowthis has from the earliest times been reckoned a bird of bad omen and in julius csar v 1 cassius on the eve of battle predicted a defeat because to use his own words

crows and kites
fly oer our heads and downward look on us
as we were sickly prey their shadows seem
a canopy most fatal under which
our army lies ready to give up the ghost

allusions to the same superstition occur in troilus and cressida i 2 king john v 2 etc virgil bucolic i 18 mentions the croaking of the crow as a bad omen

spe sinistra cava prdixit ab ilice cornix
and butler in his hudibras part ii canto 3 remarks

is it not ominous in all countries
when crows and ravens croak upon trees

even children nowadays regard with no friendly feelings this bird of illomen 1 and in the north of england there is a rhyme to the following effect

crow crow get out of my sight
or else i'll eat thy liver and lights

among other allusions mentioned by shakspeare to the crow may be noticed the crowkeepera person employed to drive away crows from the fields at present in all the midland counties a boy set to drive away the birds is said to keep birds hence a stuffed figure now called a scarecrow was also called a crowkeeper as in king lear iv 6

that fellow handles his bow like a crowkeeper
one of tusser's directions for september is

no sooner asowing but out byandby
with mother or boy that alarum can cry
and let them be armed with a sling or a bow
to scare away pigeon the rook or the crow

in romeo and juliet i 4 a scarecrow seems meant

bearing a tartar's painted bow of lath
scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper

among further references to this practice is that in 1 henry vi i 4 where lord talbot relates that when a prisoner in france he was publicly exhibited in the marketplace

here said they is the terror of the french
the scarecrow that affrights our children so
and once more in measure for measure ii 1

we must not make a scarecrow of the law
setting it up to fear the birds of prey
and let it keep one shape till custom make it
their perch and not their terror

the phrase to pluck a crow is to complain goodnaturedly but reproachfully and to threaten retaliation it occurs in comedy of errors iii 1we'll pluck a crow together sometimes the word pull is substituted for pluck as in butler's hudibras part ii canto 2

if not resolve before we go
that you and i must pull a crow

the crow has been regarded as the emblem of darkness which has not escaped the notice of shakspeare who in pericles iv introd speaking of the white dove says

with the dove of paphos might the crow
vie feathers white

cuckoomany superstitions have clustered round the cuckoo and both in this country and abroad it is looked upon as a mysterious bird being supposed to possess the gift of second sight a notion referred to in love's labour's lost v 2

cuckoo cuckoo  o word of fear
unpleasing to a married ear

and again in midsummer night's dream iii 1 bottom sings

the plainsong cuckoo gray
whose note full many a man doth mark
and dares not answer nay


it is still a common idea that the cuckoo if asked will tell anyone by the repetition of its cries how long he has to live the country lasses in sweden count the cuckoo's call to ascertain how many years they have to remain unmarried but they generally shut their ears and run away on hearing it a few times  among the germans the notes of the cuckoo when heard in spring for the first time are considered a good omen csarius ad 1222 tells us of a convertite who was about to become a monk but changed his mind on hearing the cuckoo's call and counting twentytwo repetitions of it come said he i have certainly twentytwo years still to live and why should i mortify myself during all that time i will go back to the world enjoy its delights for twenty years and devote the remaining two to penitence  in england the peasantry salute the cuckoo with the following invocation

cuckoo cherrytree
good bird tell me
how many years have i to live

the allusion to the cherrytree having probably originated in the popular fancy that before the cuckoo ceases its song it must eat three good meals of cherries pliny mentions the belief that when the cuckoo came to maturity it devoured the bird which had reared it a superstition several times alluded to by shakespeare thus in king lear i 4 the fool remarks

the hedgesparrow fed the cuckoo so long
that it's had it head bit off by it young

again in 1 henry iv v 1 worcester says

and being fed by us you used us so
as that ungentle gull the cuckoo's bird
useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
that even our love durst not come near your sight
for fear of swallowing

once more the opinion that the cuckoo made no nest of its own but laid its eggs in that of another bird is mentioned in antony and cleopatra ii 6

thou dost oercount me of my father's house
but since the cuckoo builds not for himself
remain int as thou mayst

it has been remarked however in reference to the common idea that the young cuckoo illtreats its foster mother that if we watch the movements of the two birds when the younger is being fed we cannot much wonder at this piece of folklore when the cuckoo opens its great mouth the diminutive nurse places her own head so far within its precincts that it has the exact appearance of a voluntary surrender to decapitation

the notion which couples the name of the cuckoo with the character of the man whose wife is unfaithful to him appears to have been derived from the romans and is first found in the middle ages in france and in the countries of which the modern language is derived from the latin but the ancients more correctly gave the name of the bird not to the husband of the faithless wife but to her paramour who might justly be supposed to be acting the part of the cuckoo they applied the name of the bird in whose nest the cuckoo's eggs were usually deposited'carruca'to the husband it is not quite clear how in the passage from classic to medival the application of the term was transferred to the husband in further allusion to this bird we may quote the following from all's well that ends well i 3

for i the ballad will repeat
which men full true will find
your marriage comes by destiny
your cuckoo sings by kind

the cuckoo has generally been regarded as the harbinger of spring and according to a gloucestershire rhyme

the cuckoo comes in april
sings a song in may
then in june another tune
and then she flies away

thus in 1 henry iv iii 2 henry iv alluding to his predecessor says

so when he had occasion to be seen
he was but as the cuckoo is in june
heard not regarded

in love's labour's lost v 2 spring is maintained by the cuckoo in those charming sonnets descriptive of the beauties of the country at this season

the word cuckoo has from the earliest times been used as a term of reproach and plautus has introduced it on more than one occasion in this sense we find it quoted by shakespeare in 1 henry iv ii 4o horseback ye cuckoo the term cuckold too which so frequently occurs throughout shakespeare's plays is generally derived from cuculus from the practice already alluded to of depositing its eggs in other birds nests

domestic fowlin the tempest v 1 the word chick is used as a term of endearment nay arise chick c and in macbeth iv 3 macduff speaks of his children as all my pretty chickens in coriolanus v 3 hen is applied to a womanpoor hen fond of no second brood and in taming of the shrew ii 1 petruchio says so kate will be my hen and once more 1 henry iv iii 3 falstaff says how now dame partlet the hen in othello i 3 iago applies the term guineahen to desdemona a cant phrase in shakespeare's day for a fast woman

doveamong the many beautiful allusions to this bird we may mention one in hamlet v 1 where shakespeare speaks of the dove only laying two eggs

as patient as the female dove
when that her golden couplets are disclosed

the young nestlings when first disclosed are only covered with a yellow down and the mother rarely leaves the nest in consequence of the tenderness of her young hence the dove has been made an emblem of patience in 2 henry iv iv 1 it is spoken of as the symbol of peacethe dove and very blessed spirit of peace and in the taming of the shrew ii 1 we find the expression as modest as the dove its love too is several times referred to as in romeo ii 1 pronounce but'love' and 'dove' and in 1 henry vi ii 2 burgundy says

like to a pair of loving turtledoves
that could not live asunder day or night
this bird has also been regarded as the emblem of fidelity as in the following graphic passage in troilus and cressida iii 2

as true as steel as plantage to the moon
as sun to day as turtle to her mate
as iron to adamant as earth to the centre

and in winter's tale iv 4 we readturtles pair that never mean to part its modesty is alluded to in the taming of the shrew ii 1modest as the dove and its innocence in 2 henry vi iii 1 is mentioned where king henry says

our kinsman gloucester is as innocent
from meaning treason to our royal person
as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
the duke is virtuous mild and too well given
to dream on evil or to work my downfall

the custom of giving a pair of doves or pigeons as a present or peaceoffering is alluded to in titus andronicus iv 4 where the clown says god and saint stephen give you good den i have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here and when gobbo tried to find favour with bassanio in merchant of venice ii 2 he began by sayingi have here a dish of doves that i would bestow on your worship shakespeare alludes in several places to the doves of venus as in venus and adonis

thus weary of the world away she venus hies
and yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
their mistress mounted through the empty skies
in her light chariot quickly is conveyed
holding their course to paphos where their queen
means to immure herself and not be seen


and in a midsummer night's dream i 1 where hermia speaks of the simplicity of venus doves this will also explain says mr harting the reference to the dove of paphos in pericles iv introduction the towns of old and new paphos are situated on the southwest extremity of the coast of cyprus old paphos is the one generally referred to by the poets being the peculiar seat of the worship of venus who was fabled to have been wafted thither after her birth amid the waves the dove of paphos may therefore be considered as synonymous with the dove of venus

mahomet we are told had a dove which he used to feed with wheat out of his ear when hungry the dove lighted on his shoulder and thrust its bill in to find its breakfastmahomet persuading the rude and simple arabians that it was the holy ghost that gave him advice hence in 1 henry vi i 2 the question is asked

was mahomet inspired with a dove

ducka barbarous pastime in shakespeare's time was hunting a tame duck in the water with spaniels for the performance of this amusement it was necessary to have recourse to a pond of water sufficiently extensive to give the duck plenty of room for making its escape from the dogs when closely pursued which it did by diving as often as any of them came near it hence the following allusion in henry v ii 3

and holdfast is the only dog my duck

to swim like a duck is a common proverb which occurs in the tempest ii 2 where trinculo in reply to stephano's question how he escaped says swum ashore man like a duck i can swim like a duck i'll be sworn

eaglefrom the earliest time this bird has been associated with numerous popular fancies and superstitions many of which have not escaped the notice of shakspeare a notion of very great antiquity attributes to it the power of gazing at the sun undazzled to which spenser in his hymn of heavenly beauty refers

and like the native brood of eagle's kind
on that bright sun of glory fix thine eyes

in love's labour's lost iv 3 biron says of rosaline

what peremptory eaglesighted eye
dares look upon the heaven of her brow
that is not blinded by her majesty

and in 3 henry vi ii 1 richard says to edward prince of wales

nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird
show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun

the french naturalist lacepede has calculated that the clearness of vision in birds is nine times more extensive than that of the farthestsighted man the eagle too has always been proverbial for its great power of flight and on this account has had assigned to it the sovereignty of the feathered race aristotle and pliny both record the legend of the wren disputing for the crown a tradition which is still found in ireland the birds all met together one day and settled among themselves that whichever of them could fly highest was to be the king of them all well just as they were starting the little rogue of a wren perched itself on the eagle's tail so they flew and flew ever so high till the eagle was miles above all the rest and could not fly another stroke for he was so tired then says he i'm the king of the birds says he hurroo you lie says the wren darting up a perch and ahalf above the big fellow the eagle was so angry to think how he was outwitted by the wren that when the latter was coming down he gave him a stroke of his wing and from that day the wren has never been able to fly higher than a hawthorn bush the swiftness of the eagle's flight is spoken of in timon of athens i 1

an eagle flight bold and forth on
leaving no track behind

the great age too of the eagle is well known and the words of the psalmist are familiar to most readers

his youth shall be renewed like the eagle's

apemantus however asks of timon timon of athens iv 3

will these mossd trees
that have outlived the eagle page thy heels
and skip where thou pointst out

tuberville in his book of falconry 1575 says that the great age of this bird has been ascertained from the circumstance of its always building its eyrie or nest in the same place the romans considered the eagle a bird of good omen and its presence in time of battle was supposed to foretell victory thus in julius csar v 1 we read

coming from sardis on our former ensign
two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd
gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands

it was selected for the roman legionary standard through being the king and most powerful of all birds as a bird of good omen it is mentioned also in cymbeline i 1

i chose an eagle and did avoid a puttock
and in another scene iv 2 the soothsayer relates how last night the very gods shewd me a vision thus

i saw jove's bird the roman eagle wingd
from the spongy south to this part of the west
there vanishd in the sunbeams which portends
unless my sins abuse my divination
success to th roman host

the conscious superiority of the eagle is depicted by tamora in titus andronicus iv 4

the eagle suffers little birds to sing
and is not careful what they mean thereby
knowing that with the shadow of his wing
he can at pleasure stint their melody


goosethis bird was the subject of many quaint proverbial phrases often used in the old popular writers thus a tailor's goose was a jocular name for his pressing iron probably from its being often roasting before the fire an allusion to which occurs in macbeth ii 3

come in tailor here you may roast your goose

the wildgoose chase which is mentioned in romeo and juliet ii 4

mercutionay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase i have done

was a kind of horserace which resembled the flight of wildgeese two horses were started together and whichever rider could get the lead the other was obliged to follow him over whatever ground the foremost jockey chose to go that horse which could distance the other won the race this reckless sport is enumerated by burton in his anatomy of melancholy as a recreation much in vogue in his time among gentlemen the term winchester goose was a cant phrase for a certain venereal disease because the stews in southwark were under the jurisdiction of the bishop of winchester to whom gloucester tauntingly applies the term in the following passage 1 henry vi i 3

winchester goose i cry a rope a rope

in troilus and cressida v 10 there is a further allusion

some galled goose of winchester would hiss

ben jonson  calls it

the winchestrian goose
bred on the banke in time of popery
when venus there maintaind the mystery

plucking geese was formerly a barbarous sport of boys merry wives of windsor v 1 which consisted in stripping a living goose of its feathers

in coriolanus i 4 the goose is spoken of as the emblem of cowardice marcius says

you souls of geese
that hear the shapes of men how have you run
from slaves that apes would beat

goldfinchthe warwickshire name for this bird is proud tailor to which some commentators think the words in 1 henry iv iii 1 refer

lady pi will not sing
hotsptis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast teacher

it has therefore been suggested that the passage should be read thustis the next way to turn tailor or redbreast teacher ie to turn teacher of goldfinches or redbreasts 2 singer 3 however explains the words thustailors like weavers have ever been remarkable for their vocal skill percy is jocular in his mode of persuading his wife to sing and this is a humorous turn which he gives to his argument 'come sing' 'i will not sing' 'tis the next ie the readiest nearest way to turn tailor or redbreast teacher'the meaning being to sing is to put yourself upon a level with tailors and teachers of birds

gullshakespeare often uses this word as synonymous with fool thus in henry v iii 6 he says

why tis a gull a fool
the same play upon the word occurs in othello v 2 and in timon of athens ii 1 in twelfth night v 1 malvolio asks

why have you sufferd me to be imprisond
kept in a dark house visited by the priest
and made the most notorious geck and gull
that eer invention played on tell me why

it is also used to express a trick or imposition as in much ado about nothing ii 3i should think this a gull but that the whitebearded fellow speaks it 1 gullcatchers or gullgropers to which reference is made in twelfth nightii 5 where fabian on the entry of maria exclaims

here comes my noble gullcatcher

were the names by which sharpers were known in shakespeare's time  the gullcatcher was generally an old usurer who lent money to a gallant at an ordinary who had been unfortunate in play 4 decker devotes a chapter to this character in his lanthorne and candlelight 1612 according to him the gullgroper is commonly an old monymonger who having travailed through all the follyes of the world in his youth knowes them well and shunnes them in his age his whole felicitie being to fill his bags with golde and silver the person so duped was termed a gull and the trick also in that disputed passage in the tempest ii 2 where caliban addressing trinculo says

sometimes i'll get thee
young scamels from the rock

some think that the seamew or seagull is intended seamall or seamell being still a provincial name for this bird mr stevenson in his birds of norfolk ii p 260 tells us that the female bartailed godwit is called a 'scammell' by the gunners of blakeney but as this bird is not a rockbreeder 6 it cannot be the one intended in the present passage if we regard it as an accurate description from a naturalist's point of view holt says that scam is a limpet and scamell probably a diminutive mr dyce 7 reads scamels ie the kestrel stannel or windhover which breeds in rocky situations and high cliffs on our coasts he also further observes that this accords well with the context from the rock and adds that staniel or staunyel occurs in twelfth night ii 5 where all the old editions exhibit the gross misprint stallion

hawkthe diversion of catching game with hawks was very popular in shakespeare's time and hence as might be expected we find many scattered allusions to it throughout his plays the training of a hawk for the field was an essential part of the education of a young saxon nobleman and the present of a welltrained hawk was a gift to be welcomed by a king edward the confessor spent much of his leisure time in either hunting or hawking and in the reign of edward iii we read how the bishop of ely attended the service of the church at bermondsey southwark leaving his hawk in the cloister which in the meantime was stolenthe bishop solemnly excommunicating the thieves on one occasion henry viii met with a serious accident when pursuing his hawk at hitchin in hertfordshire in jumping over a ditch his pole broke and he fell headlong into the muddywater where he was with some difficulty rescued by one of his followers sir thomas moore writing in the reign of henry viii describing the state of manhood makes a young man say

manhod i am therefore i me delyght
to hunt and hawke to nourish up and fede
the greyhounde to the course the hawke to th flight
and to bestryde a good and lusty stede

in noticing then shakespeare's allusions to this sport we have a good insight into its various features and also gain a knowledge of the several terms associated with it thus frequent mention is made of the word haggarda wild untrained hawkand in the following allegory taming of the shrew iv 1 where it occurs much of the knowledge of falconry is comprised

my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
and till she stoop she must not be fullgorged

for then she never looks upon her lure
another way i have to man my haggard
to make her come and know her keeper's call
that is to watch her as we watch these kites
that bate and beat and will not be obedient
she eat no meat today nor none shall eat
last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not

further allusions occur in twelfth night iii 1 where viola says of the clown

this fellow is wise enough to play the fool
and to do that well craves a kind of wit
he must observe their mood on whom he jests
the quality of persons and the time
and like the haggard check at every feather
that comes before his eye

in much ado about nothing hero iii 1 speaking of beatrice says that

her spirits are as coy and wild
as haggerds of the rock

and othello iii 3 mistrusting desdemona and likening her to a hawk exclaims

if i do prove her haggard
ild whistle her off

the word check alluded to above was a term in falconry applied to a hawk when she forsook her proper game and followed some other of inferior kind that crossed her in her flight 3being mentioned again in hamlet iv 7 where the king says

if he be now returnd
as checking at his voyage


another common expression used in falconry is tower applied to certain hawks etc which tower aloft soar spirally to a height in the air and thence swoop upon their prey in macbeth ii 4 we read of a falcon towering in her pride of place in 2 henry vi ii 1 suffolk says my lord protector's hawks do tower so well and in king john v 2 the bastard says and like an eagle oer his aery 1 towers

the word quarry which occurs several times in shakespeare's plays in some instances means the game or prey sought the etymology has says nares been variously attempted but with little success it may perhaps originally have meant the square or inclosure carre into which the game was driven as is still practised in other countries and hence the application of it to the game there caught would be a natural extension of the term randle holme in his academy of armory book ii c xi p 240 defines it as the fowl which the hawk flyeth at whether dead or alive it was also equivalent to a heap of slaughtered game as in the following passages in coriolanus i 1 caius marcius saysild make a quarry with thousands of these quarterd slaves in macbeth iv 3 2 we read the quarry of these murderd deer and in hamlet v 2 this quarry cries on havoc

another term in falconry is stoop or swoop'' denoting the hawk's violent descent from a height upon its prey in taming of the shrew iv 1 the expression occurs till she stoop she must not be fullgorged in henry v iv 1 king henry speaking of the king says though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing in macbeth too iv 3 macduff referring to the cruel murder of his children exclaims what at one fell swoop 1 webster in the white devil 2 says

if she ie fortune give aught she deals it in small parcels
that she may take away all at one swoop

shakespeare gives many incidental allusions to the hawk's trappings thus in lucreece he says

harmless lucretia marking what he tells
with trembling fear as fowl hear falcon's bells

and in as you like it iii 3  touchstone says as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires the object of these bells was to lead the falconer to the hawk when in a wood or out of sight in heywood's play entitled a woman killed with kindness 1617 is a hawking scene containing a striking allusion to the hawk's bells the dress of the hawk consisted of a closefitting hood of leather or velvet enriched with needlework and surmounted with a tuft of coloured feathers for use as well as ornament inasmuch as they assisted the hand in removing the hood when the birds for the hawk's attack came in sight thus in henry v iii 7 the constable of france referring to the valour of the dauphin says tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate 5 and again in romeo and juliet iii 2 juliet says

hood my unmannd blood bating 6 in my cheeks

the jesses were two short straps of leather or silk which were fastened to each leg of a hawk to which was attached a swivel from which depended the leash or strap which the falconer 1 twisted round his hand othello iii 3 says

though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings

we find several allusions to the training of hawks they were usually trained by being kept from sleep it having been customary for the falconers to sit up by turns and watch the hawk and keep it from sleeping sometimes for three successive nights desdemona in othello iii 3 says

my lord shall never rest
i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience
his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift
i'll intermingle every thing he does
with cassio's suit

so in cartwright's lady errant ii 2

we'll keep you as they do hawks
watching until you leave your wildness

in the merry wives of windsor v 5 where page says

nay do not fly i think we have watchd you now

the allusion is says staunton to this method employed to tame or reclaim hawks

again in othello iii 3 3 iago exclaims

she that so young could give out such a seeming
to seel her father's eyes up close as oak

in allusion to the practice of seeling a hawk or sewing up its eyelids by running a fine thread through them in order to make her tractable and endure the hood of which we have already spoken henry iv 2 henry iv iii 1 in his soliloquy on sleep says

wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains
in cradle of the rude imperious surge


in spenser's fairie queen i vii 23 we read

mine eyes no more on vanity shall feed
but sealed up with death shall have their deadly meed
it was a common notion that if a dove was let loose with its eyes so closed it would fly straight upwards continuing to mount till it fell down through mere exhaustion

in cymbeline iii 4 imogen referring to posthumus says

i grieve myself
to think when thou shall be disedged by her
that now thou tirest on

this passage containing two metaphorical expressions from falconry a bird was said to be disedged when the keenness of its appetite was taken away by tiring or feeding upon some tough or hard substance given to it for that purpose in 3 henry vi i 1 the king says

that hateful duke
whose haughty spirit winged with desire
will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
tire on the flesh of me and of my son

in timon of athens iii 6 one of the lords says

upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered
in venus and adonis too we find a further allusion

even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone c

among other allusions to the hawk may be mentioned one in measure for measure iii i

this outwardsainted deputy
whose settled visage and deliberate word
nips youth i th head and follies doth emmew
as falcon doth the fowl

the word emmew signifying the place where hawks were shut up during the time they moulted in romeo and juliet iii 4 lady capulet says of juliettonight she is mewd up to her heaviness and in taming of shrew i 1 gremio speaking of bianca to signor baptista sayswhy will you mew her



when the wing or tail feathers of a hawk were dropped forced out or broken by any accident it was usual to supply or repair as many as were deficient or damaged an operation called to imp 1 a hawk thus in richard ii ii 1 northumberland says

if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
imp out our drooping country's broken wing
so massinger in his renegado v 8 makes asambeg say

strive to imp
new feathers to the broken wings of time

hawking was sometimes called birding in the merry wives of windsor iii 3 master page saysi do invite you tomorrow morning to my house to breakfast after we'll abirding together i have a fine hawk for the bush in the same play iii 5 dame quickly speaking of mistress ford saysher husband goes this morning abirding and mistress ford says iv 2he's abirding sweet st john the word hawk says mr harting is invariably used by shakspeare in its generic sense and in only two instances does he allude to a particular species these are the kestrel and sparrowhawk in twelfth night ii 5 sir toby belch speaking of malvolio as he finds the letter which maria has purposely dropped in his path says

and with what wing the staniel checks at it

staniel being a corruption of stangdall a name for the kestrel hawk gouts is the technical term for the spots on some parts of the plumage of a hawk and perhaps shakspeare uses the word in allusion to a phrase in heraldry macbeth ii 1 speaking of the dagger saysi see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood

heronthis bird was frequently flown at by falconers shakespeare in hamlet ii 2 makes hamlet say i am but mad northnorthwest when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw handsaw being a corruption of heronshaw or hernsew which is still used in the provincial dialects for a heron in suffolk and norfolk it is pronounced harnsa from which to handsaw is but a single step shakespeare here alludes to a proverbial saying he knows not a hawk from a handsaw  mr j c heath explains the passage thus the expression obviously refers to the sport of hawking most birds especially one of heavy flight like the heron when roused by the falconer or his dog would fly down or with the wind in order to escape when the wind is from the north the heron flies towards the south and the spectator may be dazzled by the sun and be unable to distinguish the hawk from the heron on the other hand when the wind is southerly the heron flies towards the north and it and the pursuing hawk are clearly seen by the sportsman who then has his back to the sun and without difficulty knows the hawk from the hernsew

jayfrom its gay and gaudy plumage this bird has been used for a loose woman as merry wives of windsor iii 3

we'll teach him to know turtles from jays
ie to distinguish honest women from loose ones again in cymbeline iii 4 imogen says

some jay of italy
whose mother was her painting hath betrayd him

kestrela hawk 5 of a base unserviceable breed and therefore used by spenser in his faerie queen ii iii 4 to signify base

ne thought of honour ever did assay
his baser breast but in his kestrell kynd
a pleasant veine of glory he did fynd

by some it is derived from coystril a knave or peasant from being the hawk formerly used by persons of inferior rank thus in twelfth night i 3 we find coystrill and in pericles iv 6 coystrel the name kestrel says singer for an inferior kind of hawk was evidently a corruption of the french quercelle or quercerelle and originally had no connection with coystril though in later times they may have been confounded holinshed 3 classes coisterels with lacqueys and women the unwarlike attendants on an army the term was also given as a nickname to the emissaries employed by the kings of england in their french wars dyce also considers kestrel distinct from coistrel

kingfisherit was a common belief in days gone by that during the days the halcyon or kingfisher was engaged in hatching her eggs the sea remained so calm that the sailor might venture upon it without incurring risk of storm or tempest hence this period was called by pliny and aristotle the halcyon days to which allusion is made in 1 henry vi i 2

expect st martin's summer halcyon days
dryden also refers to this notion

amidst our arms as quiet you shall be
as halcyons brooding on a winter's sea

another superstition connected with this bird occurs in king lear ii 1 where the earl of kent says

turn their halcyon beaks
with every gale and vary of their masters

the prevalent idea being that a dead kingfisher suspended from a cord would always turn its beak in that direction from whence the wind blew marlow in his jew of malta i 1 says

but now how stands the wind
into what corner peers my halcyon's bill

occasionally one may still see this bird hung up in cottages a remnant no doubt of this old superstition


kitethis bird was considered by the ancients to be unlucky in julius csar v 1 cassius says

ravens crows and kites
fly oer our heads and downward look on us

in cymbeline too i 2 imogen says

i chose an eagle and did avoid a puttock

puttock here being a synonym sometimes applied to the kite formerly the kite became a term of reproach from its ignoble habits thus in antony and cleopatra iii 13 antony exclaims you kite and king lear i 4 says to goneril detested kite thou liest its intractable disposition is alluded to in taming of the shrew by petruchio iv 1 a curious peculiarity of this bird is noticed in winter's tale iv 3 where autolycus saysmy traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linenmeaning that his practice was to steal sheets leaving the smaller linen to be carried away by the kites who will occasionally carry it off to line their nests mr dyce quotes the following remarks of mr peck on this passageautolycus here gives us to understand that he is a thief of the first class this he explains by an allusion to an odd vulgar notion the common people many of them think that if anyone can find a kite's nest when she hath young before they are fledged and sew up their back doors so as they cannot mute the mother kite in compassion to their distress will steal lesser linen as caps cravats ruffles or any other such small matters as she can best fly with from off the hedges where they are hanged to dry after washing and carry them to her nest and there leave them if possible to move the pity of the first corner to cut the thread and ease them of their misery

lapwingseveral interesting allusions are made by shakespeare to this eccentric bird it was a common notion that the young lapwings ran out of the shell with part of it sticking on their heads in such haste were they to be hatched horatio hamlet v 2 says of osric

this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head


it was therefore regarded as the symbol of a forward fellow webster in the white devil 1859 p 13

forward lapwing
he flies with the shell ons head

the lapwing like the partridge is also said to draw pursuers from her nest by fluttering along the ground in an opposite direction or by crying in other places thus in the comedy of errors iv 2 shakespeare says

far from her nest the lapwing cries away

again in measure for measure i 4 lucio exclaims

though tis my familiar sin
with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
tongue far from heart

once more in much ado about nothing iii 1 we read

for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs
close by the ground to hear our conference

several too of our older poets refer to this peculiarity in ben jonson's underwoods lviii we are told

where he that knows will like a lapwing fly
farre from the nest and so himself belie

through thus alluring intruders from its nest the lapwing became a symbol of insincerity and hence originated the proverb the lapwing cries tongue from heart or the lapwing cries most farthest from her nest

larkshakespeare has bequeathed to us many exquisite passages referring to the lark full of the most sublime pathos and lofty conceptions most readers are doubtless acquainted with that superb song in cymbeline ii 3 where this sweet songster is represented as singing at heaven's gate and again as the bird of dawn it is described in venus and adonis thus

lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
from his moist cabinet mounts up on high
and wakes the morning from whose silver breast
the sun ariseth in his majesty

in love's labour's lost v 2 song we have a graphic touch of pastoral life

when shepherds pipe on oaten straws
and merry larks are ploughmen's clocks

the words of portia too in merchant of venice v 1 to sing as sweetly as the lark have long ago passed into a proverb

it was formerly a current saying that the lark and toad changed eyes to which juliet refers in romeo and juliet iii 5

some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes

warburton says this popular fancy originated in the toad having very fine eyes and the lark very ugly ones this tradition was formerly expressed in a rustic rhyme

to heavn id fly
but that the toad beguild me of mine eye

in henry viii iii 2 the earl of surrey in denouncing wolsey alludes to a curious method of capturing larks which was effected by small mirrors and red cloth these scaring the birds made them crouch while the fowler drew his nets over them

let his grace go forward
and dare us with his cap like larks

in this case the cap was the scarlet hat of the cardinal which it was intended to use as a piece of red cloth the same idea occurs in skelton's why come ye not to court a satire on wolsey

the red hat with his lure
bringeth all things under cure

the words tirralyra winter's tale iv 3 are a fanciful combination of sounds meant to imitate the lark's note borrowed says nares from the french tirelire browne british pastorals bk i song 4 makes it teeryleery in one of the coventry pageants there is the following old song sung by the shepherds at the birth of christ which contains the expression

as i out rode this endenes night
of three joli shepherds i sawe a syght
and all aboute there fold a stare shone bright
they sang terli terlow
so mereli the sheppards their pipes can blow

in scotland and the north of england the peasantry say that if one is desirous of knowing what the lark says he must lie down on his back in the field and listen and he will then hear it say

up in the lift go we
tehee tehee tehee tehee
there's not a shoemaker on the earth
can make a shoe to me to me
why so why so why so
because my heel is as long as my toe

magpieit was formerly known as magotpie probably from the french magot a monkey because the bird chatters and plays droll tricks like a monkey it has generally been regarded as a mysterious bird and regarded with superstitious awe and is thus alluded to in macbeth iii 4

augurs and understood relations have
by magotpies and choughs and rooks brought forth
the secretst man of blood
and again in 3 henry vi v 6 it is said

chattering pies in dismal discords sung
there are numerous rhymes relating to the magpie of which we subjoin as a specimen one prevalent in the north of england

one is sorrow two mirth
three a wedding four a birth
five heaven six hell
seven the deil's ain sell

in devonshire in order to avert the illluck from seeing a magpie the peasant spits over his right shoulder three times and in yorkshire various charms are in use one is to raise the hat as a salutation and then to sign the cross on the breast and another consists in making the same sign by crossing the thumbs it is a common notion in scotland that magpies flying near the windows of a house portend a speedy death to one of its inmates the superstitions associated with the magpie are not confined to this country for in sweden 1 it is considered the witch's bird belonging to the evil one and the other powers of night in denmark when a magpie perches on a house it is regarded as a sign that strangers are coming

martinthe martin or martlet which is called in macbeth i 6 the guest of summer as being a migratory bird has been from the earliest times treated with superstitious respectit being considered unlucky to molest or in any way injure its nest thus in the merchant of venice ii 9 the prince of arragon says

the martlet
builds in the weather on the outward wall
even in the force and road of casualty

forster says that the circumstance of this bird's nest being built so close to the habitations of man indicates that it has long enjoyed freedom from molestation there is a popular rhyme still current in the north of england

the martin and the swallow
are god almighty's bow and arrow
the nightingalethe popular error that the nightingale sings with its breast impaled upon a thorn is noticed by shakespeare who makes lucreece say

and whiles against a thorn thou bearst thy part
to keep thy sharp woes waking
in the passionate pilgrim xxi there is an allusion

everything did banish moan
save the nightingale alone
she poor bird as all forlorn
leand her breast uptill a thorn
and there sung the dolefullst ditty
that to hear it was great pity
beaumont and fletcher in the faithful shepherdess v 3 speak of

the nightingale among the thickleaved spring
that sits alone in sorrow and doth sing
whole nights away in mourning

sir thomas browne asks whether the nightingale's sitting with her breast against a thorn be any more than that she placeth some prickles on the outside of her nest or roosteth in thorny prickly places where serpents may least approach her in the zoologist for 1862 the rev a c smith mentions the discovery on two occasions of a strong thorn projecting upwards in the centre of the nightingale's nest another notion is that the nightingale never sings by day and thus portia in merchant of venice v 1 says

i think
the nightingale if she could sing by day
when every goose is cackling would be thought
no better a musician than the wren

such however is not the case for this bird often sings as sweetly in the day as at nighttime there is an old superstition 3 that the nightingale sings all night to keep itself awake lest the glowworm should devour her the classical fable of the unhappy philomela turned into a nightingale when her sister progne was changed to a swallow has doubtless given rise to this bird being spoken of as she thus juliet tells romeo iii 5

it was the nightingale and not the lark
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree
believe me love it was the nightingale

sometimes the nightingale is termed philomel as in midsummer night's dream ii 2 song 1

philomel with melody
sing your sweet lullaby

ospreythis bird also called the seaeagle besides having a destructive power of devouring fish was supposed formerly to have a fascinating influence both which qualities are alluded to in the following passage in coriolanus iv 7

i think he'll be to rome
as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
by sovereignty of nature

drayton in his polyolbion song xxv mentions the same fascinating power of the osprey

the osprey oft here seen though seldom here it breeds
which over them the fish no sooner do espy
but betwixt him and them by an antipathy
turning their bellies up as though their death they saw
they at his pleasure lie to stuff his gluttonous maw

ostrichthe extraordinary digestion of this bird is said to be shown by its swallowing iron and other hard substances in 2 henry vi iv 10 the rebel cade says to alexander idenah villain thou wilt betray me and get a thousand crowns of the king by carrying my head to him but i'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and i part cuvier speaking of this bird says it is yet so voracious and its senses of taste and smell are so obtuse that it devours animal and mineral substances indiscriminately until its enormous stomach is completely full it swallows without any choice and merely as it were to serve for ballast wood stones grass iron copper gold lime or in fact any other substance equally hard indigestible and deleterious sir thomas browne writing on this subject says the ground of this conceit in its swallowing down fragments of iron which men observing by a forward illation have therefore conceived it digesteth them which is an inference not to be admitted as being a fallacy of the consequent in loudon's magazine of natural history no 6 p 32 we are told of an ostrich having been killed by swallowing glass

owlthe dread attached to this unfortunate bird is frequently spoken of by shakespeare who has alluded to several of the superstitions associated with it at the outset many of the epithets ascribed to it show the prejudice with which it was regardedbeing in various places stigmatised as the vile owl in troilus and cressida ii 1 and the obscure bird in macbeth ii 3 etc from the earliest period it has been considered a bird of illomen and pliny tells us how on one occasion even rome itself underwent a lustration because one of them strayed into the capitol he represents it also as a funereal bird a monster of the night the very abomination of human kind virgil describes its deathhowl from the top of the temple by night a circumstance introduced as a precursor of dido's death ovid too constantly speaks of this bird's presence as an evil omen and indeed the same notions respecting it may be found among the writings of most of the ancient poets this superstitious awe in which the owl is held may be owing to its peculiar look its occasional and uncertain appearance its loud and dismal cry as well as to its being the bird of night 5 it has generally been associated with calamities and deeds of darkness 6 thus its weird shriek pierces the ear of lady macbeth ii 2 while the murder is being committed

harkpeace
it was the owl that shriekd the fatal bellman
which gives the sternst good night

and when the murderer rushes in exclaiming

i have done the deed didst thou not hear a noise
she answers

i heard the owl scream

its appearance at a birth has been said to foretell illluck to the infant a superstition to which king henry in 3 henry vi v 6 addressing gloucester refers

the owl shriekd at thy birth an evil sign

its cries 1 have been supposed to presage death and to quote the words of the spectator a screechowl at mid night has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers thus in a midsummer night's dream v 1 we are told how

the screechowl screeching loud
puts the wretch that lies in woe
in remembrance of a shroud

and in 1 henry vi iv 2 it is called the ominous and fearful hour of death again when richard iii iv 4 is exasperated by the bad news he interrupts the third messenger by saying

out on you owls nothing but songs of death
the owl by day is considered by some equally ominous as in 3 henry vi v 4 1

the owl by day
if he arise is mockd and wonderd at
and in julius csar i 3 casca says

and yesterday the bird of night did sit
even at noonday upon the marketplace
hooting and shrieking when these prodigies
do so conjointly meet let not men say
these are their reasonsthey are natural'
for i believe they are portentous things
unto the climate that they point upon

considering however the abhorrence with which the owl is generally regarded it is not surprising that the owlet's wing should form an ingredient of the cauldron in which the witches in macbeth iv 1 prepared their charm of powerful trouble the owl is too in all probability represented by shakespeare as a witch 1 a companion of the fairies in their moonlight gambols in comedy of errors ii 2 dromio of syracuse says

this is the fairy land o spite of spites
we talk with goblins owls and elvish sprites
if we obey them not this will ensue
they'll suck our breath and pinch us black and blue

singer in his notes on this passage ii p 28 saysit has been asked how should shakespeare know that screechowls were considered by the romans as witches do these cavillers think that shakespeare never looked into a book take an extract from the cambridge latin dictionary 1594 8vo probably the very book he used strix a scritche owle an unluckie kind of bird as they of olde time said which sucked out the blood of infants lying in their cradles a witch that changeth the favour of children an hagge or fairie so in the london prodigal a comedy 1605soul i think i am sure crossed or witchd with an owl in the tempest v 1 shakespeare introduces ariel as saying

where the bee sucks there suck i
in a cowslip's bell i lie
there i couch when owls do cry

ariel who sucks honey for luxury in the cowslip's bell retreats thither for quiet when owls are abroad and screeching according to an old legend the owl was originally a baker's daughter to which allusion is made in hamlet iv 5 where ophelia exclaimsthey say the owl was a baker's daughter lord we know what we are but know not what we may be douce says the following story was current among the gloucestershire peasantryour saviour went into a baker's shop where they were baking and asked for some bread to eat the mistress of the shop immediately put a piece of dough into the oven to bake for him but was reprimanded by her daughter who insisting that the piece of dough was too large reduced it to a very small size the dough however immediately began to swell and presently became a most enormous size whereupon the baker's daughter cried out 'heugh heugh heugh' which owllike noise probably induced our saviour to transform her into that bird for her wickedness another version of the same story as formerly known in herefordshire substitutes a fairy in the place of our saviour similar legends are found on the continent

parrotthe popinjay in 1 henry iv i 3 is another name for the parrotfrom the spanish papagayoa term which occurs in browne's pastorals ii 65

or like the mixture nature dothe display
upon the quaint wings of the popinjay

its supposed restlessness before rain is referred to in as you like it iv 1more clamorous than a parrot against rain it was formerly customary to teach the parrot unlucky words with which when anyone was offended it was the standing joke of the wise owner to say take heed sir my parrot prophesiesan allusion to which custom we find in comedy of errors iv 4 where dromio of ephesus saysprophesy like the parrot beware the rope's end to this butler hints where speaking of ralpho's skill in augury he says 2

could tell what subtlest parrots mean
that speak and think contrary clean
what member tis of whom they talk
when they cry rope and walk knave walk

the rewards given to parrots to encourage them to speak are mentioned in troilus and cressida v 2 3the parrot will not do more for an almond hence a proverb for the greatest temptation that could be put before a man

p 135

seems to have been an almond for a parrot to talk like a parrot is a common proverb a sense in which it occurs in othello ii 3

peacockthis bird was as proverbially used for a proud vain fool as the lapwing for a silly one in this sense some would understand it in the much disputed passage in hamlet iii 2

for thou dost know o damon dear
this realm dismantled was
of jove himself and now reigns here
a very verypeacock

the third and fourth folios reads pajock the other editions have paiock paiocke or pajocke and in the later quartos the word was changed to paicock and pecock whence pope printed peacock

dyce says that in scotland the peacock is called the peajock some have proposed to read paddock and in the last scene hamlet bestows this opprobrious name upon the king it has been also suggested to read puttock a kite  the peacock has also been regarded as the emblem of pride and arrogance as in 1 henry vi iii 3 4

let frantic talbot triumph for a while
and like a peacock sweep along his tail
we'll pull his plumes and take away his train

pelicanthere are several allusions by shakespeare to the pelican's piercing her own breast to feed her young thus in hamlet iv 5 laertes says

to his good friends thus wide i'll ope my arms
and like the kind liferendering pelican
repast them with my blood

and in king lear where the young pelicans are represented as piercing their mother's breast to drink her blood an illustration of filial impiety iii 4 the king says

is it the fashion that discarded fathers
should have thus little mercy on their flesh
judicious punishment twas this flesh begot
those pelican daughters

it is a common notion that the fable here alluded to is a classical one but this is an error shakespeare says mr harting was content to accept the story as he found it and to apply it metaphorically as the occasion required mr houghton in an interesting letter to land and water  on this subject remarks that the egyptians believed in a bird feeding its young with its blood and this bird is none other than the vulture he goes on to say that the fable of the pelican doubtless originated in the patristic annotations on the scriptures the ecclesiastical fathers transferred the egyptian story from the vulture to the pelican but magnified the story a hundredfold for the blood of the parent was not only supposed to serve as food for the young but was also able to reanimate the dead offspring augustine commenting on psalm cii 6i am like a pelican of the wildernessremarksthese birds male pelicans are said to kill their offspring by blows of their beaks and then to bewail their death for the space of three days at length however it is said that the mother inflicts a severe wound on herself pouring the flowing blood over the dead young ones which instantly brings them to life to the same effect write eustathius isidorus epiphanius and a host of other writers

according to another idea pelicans are hatched dead but the cock pelican then wounds his breast and lets one drop of blood fall upon each and this quickens them


pheasantthis bird is only once alluded to in winter's tale iv 4 where the clown jokingly says to the shepherdadvocate's the court word for a pheasant say you have none

phnixmany allusions are given to this fabulous bird which is said to rise again from its own ashes thus in henry viii v 4 cranmer tells how

when
the bird of wonder dies the maiden phnix
her ashes new create another heir
as great in admiration as herself

again in 3 henry vi i 4 the duke of york exclaims

my ashes as the phnix may bring forth
a bird that will revenge upon you all

once more in henry vi iv 7 sir william lucy speaking of talbot and those slain with him predicts that from their ashes shall be reard a phnix that shall make all france afeard

sir thomas browne tells us that there is but one phnix in the world which after many hundred years burns herself and from the ashes thereof ariseth up another from the very earliest times there have been countless traditions respecting this wonderful bird thus its longevity has been estimated from three hundred to fifteen hundred years and among the various localities assigned as its home are ethiopia arabia egypt and india in the phnix and the turtle it is said

let the bird of loudest lay
on the sole arabian tree
herald sad and trumpet be

pliny says of this bird howbeit i cannot tell what to make of him and first of all whether it be a tale or no that there is never but one of them in the whole world and the same not commonly seen malone 3 quotes from lyly's euphues and his england p 312 ed arber for as there is but one phnix in the world so is there but one tree in arabia wherein she buyldeth and florio's new worlde of wordes 1598 rasin a tree in arabia whereof there is but one found and upon it the phnix sits

pigeonas carriers these birds have been used from a very early date and the castle of the birds at bagdad takes its name from the pigeonpost which the old monks of the convent established the building has crumbled into ruins long ago by the lapse of time but the bird messengers of bagdad became celebrated as far westward as greece and were a regular commercial institution between the distant parts of asia minor arabia and the east in ancient egypt also the carrier breed was brought to great perfection and between the cities of the nile and the red sea the old traders used to send word of their caravans to each other by letters written on silk and tied under the wings of trained doves in titus andronicus iv 3 titus on seeing a clown enter with two pigeons saysnews news from heaven marcus the post is come sirrah what tidings have you any letters from the same play we also learn that it was also customary to give a pair of pigeons as a present the clown says to saturninus iv 4 i have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here

in romeo and juliet i 3 the dove is used synonymously for pigeon where the nurse is represented as sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall 3 mr darwin in his variation of animals and plants under domestication i pp 204 205 has shown that from the very earliest times pigeons have been kept in a domesticated state he saysthe earliest record of pigeons in a domesticated condition occurs in the 5th egyptian dynasty about 3000 bc but mr birch of the british museum informs me that the pigeon appears in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty domestic pigeons are mentioned in genesis leviticus and isaiah pliny informs us that the romans gave immense prices for pigeons 'nay they are come to this pass that they can reckon up their pedigree and race' in india about the year 1600 pigeons were much valued by akber khan 20000 birds were carried about with the court in most countries too the breeding and taming of pigeons have been a favourite recreation the constancy of the pigeon has been proverbial from time immemorial allusions to which occur in winter's tale iv 3 and in as you like it iii 3

quailthe quail was thought to be an amorous bird and hence was metaphorically used to denote people of a loose character in this sense it is generally understood in troilus and cressida v 1 here's agamemnon an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails mr harting however thinks that the passage just quoted refers to the practice formerly prevalent of keeping quails and making them fight like gamecocks the context of the passage would seem to sanction the former meaning quail fighting is spoken of in antony and cleopatra ii 3 where antony speaking of the superiority of csar's fortunes to his own says

if we draw lots he speeds
his cocks do win the battle still of mine
when it is all to nought and his quails ever
beat mine inhoopd at odds

it appears that cocks as well as quails were sometimes made to fight within a broad hoophence the term inhoopdto keep them from quitting each other quailfights were well known among the ancients and especially at athens julius pollux relates that a circle was made in which the birds were placed and he whose quail was driven out of this circle lost the stake which was sometimes money and occasionally the quails themselves another practice was to produce one of these birds which being first smitten with the middle finger a feather was then plucked from its head if the quail bore this operation without flinching his master gained the stake but lost it if he ran away some doubt exists as to whether quailfighting prevailed in the time of shakespeare at the present day 1 the sumatrans practise these quail combats and this pastime is common in some parts of italy and also in china mr douce has given a curious print from an elegant chinese miniature painting which represents some ladies engaged at this amusement where the quails are actually inhooped

ravenperhaps no bird is so universally unpopular as the raven its hoarse croak in most countries being regarded as ominous hence as might be expected shakespeare often refers to it in order to make the scene he depicts all the more vivid and graphic in titus andronicus ii 3 tamora describing a barren detested vale says

the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
oercome with moss and baleful mistletoe
here never shines the sun here nothing breeds
unless the nightly owl or fatal raven

and in julius csar v 1 cassius tells us how ravens

fly oer our heads and downward look on us
as we were sickly prey

it seems that the superstitious dread  attaching to this bird has chiefly arisen from its supposed longevity and its frequent mention and agency in holy writ by the romans it was consecrated to apollo and was believed to have a prophetic knowledgea notion still very prevalent thus its supposed faculty of smelling death still renders its presence or even its voice ominous othello iv i exclaims

o it comes oer my memory
as doth the raven oer the infected house
boding to all

there is no doubt a reference here to the fanciful notion that it was a constant attendant on a house infected with the plague most readers too are familiar with that famous passage in macbeth i 5 where lady macbeth having heard of the king's intention to stay at the castle exclaims

the raven himself is hoarse
that croaks the fatal entrance of duncan
under my battlements come you spirits
that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
and fill me from the crown to the toe topfull
of direst cruelty

we may compare spenser's language in the faerie queene bk ii c vii 23

after him owles and night ravens flew
the hateful messengers of heavy things
of death and dolor telling sad tidings

and once more the following passage from drayton's barons wars book v st 42 illustrates the same idea

the ominous raven often he doth hear
whose croaking him of following horror tells

in much ado about nothing ii 3 the nightraven is mentioned benedick observes to himselfi had as lief have heard the nightraven come what plague could have come after it this inauspicious bird according to steevens is the owl but this conjecture is evidently wrong being  at variance with sundry passages in our early writers who make a distinction between it and the nightraven

thus johnson in his seven champions of christendom part i speaks of the dismal cry of nightravens     and the fearefull sound of schriek owles cotgrave regarded the nightcrow and the nightraven as synonymous and mr yarrell considered them only different names for the nightheron  in 3 henry vi v 6 king henry says

the nightcrow cried aboding luckless time

goldsmith in his animated nature calls the bittern the nightraven and saysi remember in the place where i was a boy with what terror the bird's note affected the whole village they consider it as the presage of some sad event and generally found or made one to succeed it if any person in the neighbourhood died they supposed it could not be otherwise for the nightraven had foretold it but if nobody happened to die the death of a cow or a sheep gave completion to the prophecy

according to an old belief the raven deserts its own young to which shakespeare alludes in titus andronicus ii 3

some say that ravens foster forlorn children
the whilst their own birds famish in their nests
it was supposed that when the raven says mr harting saw its young ones newly hatched and covered with down it conceived such an aversion that it forsook them and did not return to the nest until a darker plumage had shown itself to this belief the commentators consider the psalmist refers when he sayshe giveth to the beast his food and to the young ravens which cry psalm cxlvii 9 we are told too in job who provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god they wander for lack of meat job xxxviii 41 shakespeare in as you like it ii 3 probably had the words of the psalmist in his mind

he that doth the ravens feed
yea providently caters for the sparrow

the raven has from earliest times been symbolical of blackness both in connection with colour and character in romeo and juliet iii 2 juliet exclaims

o serpent heart hid with a flowering face
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
dovefeatherd raven

once more ravens feathers were formerly used by witches from an old superstition that the wings of this bird carried with them contagion wherever they went hence in the tempest i 2 caliban says

as wicked dew as eer my mother brushd
with raven's feather from unwholesome fen
drop on you both

robin redbreastaccording to a pretty notion 1 this little bird is said to cover with leaves any dead body it may chance to find unburied a belief which probably in a great measure originated in the wellknown ballad of the children in the wood although it seems to have been known previously thus singer quotes as follows from cornucopia or divers secrets c by thomas johnson 1596the robin redbreast if he finds a man or woman dead will cover all his face with moss and some think that if the body should remain unburied that he would cover the whole body also in dekker's villaines discovered by lanthorn and candlelight 1616 quoted by douce it is saidthey that cheere up a prisoner but with their sight are robin redbreasts that bring strawes in their bills to cover a dead man in extremitie shakespeare in a beautiful passage in cymbeline iv 2 thus touchingly alludes to it making arviragus when addressing the supposed dead body of imogen say

with fairest flowers
while summer lasts and i live here fidele
i'll sweeten thy sad grave thou shalt not lack
the flower that like's thy face pale primrose nor
the azured harebell like thy veins no nor
the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
outsweetend not thy breath the ruddock would
with charitable billo bill sore shaming
those richleft heirs that let their fathers lie
without a monument bring thee all this
yea and furrd moss besides when flowers are none
to winterground thy corse
the ruddock being one of the old names for the redbreast

which is nowadays found in some localities john webster also refers to the same idea in the white devil 1857 edit dyce p 45

call for the robin redbreast and the wren
since oer shady groves they hover
and with leaves and flowers do cover
the friendless bodies of unburied men

drayton too in the owl has the following lines

covring with moss the dead's unclosed eye
the little redbreast teaching charitie

rookas an ominous bird this is mentioned in macbeth iii 4 formerly the nobles of england prided themselves in having a rookery in the neighbourhood of their castles because rooks were regarded as fowls of good omen on this account no one was permitted to kill them under severe penalties when rooks desert a rookery 2 it is said to foretell the downfall of the family on whose property it is a northumbrian saying informs us that the rooks left the rookery of chipchase before the family of reed left that place there is also a notion that when rooks haunt a town or village mortality is supposed to await its inhabitants and if they feed in the street it shows that a storm is at hand

the expression bullyrook in merry wives of windsor i 3 in shakespeare's time says mr harting 4 had the same meaning as jollydog nowadays but subsequently it became a term of reproach meaning a cheating sharper it has been suggested that the term derives its origin from the rook in the game of chess but douce 5 considers it very improbable that this noble game never the amusement of gamblers should have been ransacked on this occasion

snipethis bird was in shakespeare's time proverbial for a foolish man 1 in othello 1 3 iago speaking of roderigo says

for i mine own gaind knowledge should profane
if i would time expend with such a snipe
but for my sport and profit

sparrowa popular name for the common sparrow was and still is philip perhaps from its note phip phip hence the allusion to a person named philip in king john i 1

gurney good leave good philip
bastard philipsparrow

staunton says perhaps catullus alludes to this expression in the following lines

sed circumsiliens modo huc modo illuc
ad solam dominam usque pipilabat

skelton in an elegy upon a sparrow calls it phyllyp sparowe and gascoigne also writes the praise of philip sparrow

in measure for measure iii 2 lucio speaking of angelo the deputyduke of vienna sayssparrows must not build in his houseeaves because they are lecherous

sparrowhawka name formerly given to a young sparrow hawk was eyasmusket 3 a term we find in merry wives of windsor iii 3

how now myeyasmusket
what news with you

it was thus metaphorically used as a jocular phrase for a small child as the invention too of firearms took place at a time when hawking was in high fashion some of the new weapons were named after those birds probably from the idea of their fetching their prey from on high musket has thus become the established name for one sort of gun some however assert that the musket was invented in the fifteenth century and owes its name to its inventors

starlingthis was one of the birds that was in days gone by trained to speak in 1 henry iv i 3 hotspur says

i'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
nothing but 'mortimer' and give it him
to keep his anger still in motion

pliny tells us how starlings were taught to utter both latin and greek words for the amusement of the young csars and there are numerous instances on record of the clever sentences uttered by this amusing bird

swallowthis bird has generally been honoured as the harbinger of spring and athenus relates that the rhodians had a solemn song to welcome it anacreon has a well known ode shakespeare in the winter's tale iv 3 alludes to the time of the swallow's appearance in the following passage

daffodils
that come before the swallow dares and take
the winds of march with beauty

and its departure is mentioned in timon of athens iii 6 the swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship

we may compare tennyson's notice of the bird's approach and migration in the may queen

and the swallow ll come back again with summer oer the wave

it has been long considered lucky for the swallow to build its nest on the roof of a house but just as unlucky for it to forsake a place which it has once tenanted shakespeare probably had this superstition in his mind when he represents scarus as saying in antony and cleopatra iv 12

swallows have built
in cleopatra's sails their nests the augurers
say they know notthey cannot telllook grimly
and dare not speak their knowledge


swanaccording to a romantic notion dating from antiquity the swan is said to sing sweetly just before its death many pretty allusions to which we find scattered here and there throughout shakespeare's plays in merchant of venice iii 2 portia says

he makes a swanlike end
fading in music

emilia too in othello v 2 just before she dies exclaims

i will play the swan
and die in music

in king john v 7 prince henry at his father's deathbed thus pathetically speaks

tis strange that death should sing
i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
and from the organpipe of frailty sings
his soul and body to their lasting rest

again in lucrece 1611 we have these touching lines

and now this pale swan in her watery nest
begins the sad dirge of her certain ending
and once more in phnix and the turtle

let the priest in surplice white
that defunctive music can
be the deathdivining swan
lest the requiem lack his right

this superstition says douce was credited by plato chrysippus aristotle euripides philostratus cicero seneca and martial pliny lian and athenus among the ancients and sir thomas more among the moderns treat this opinion as a vulgar error luther believed in it this notion probably originated in the swan being identified with orpheus sir thomas browne says we read that after his death orpheus the musician became a swan thus was it the bird of apollo the bird of music by the greeks alluding to this piece of folklore carl engel remarksalthough our common swan does not produce sounds which might account for this tradition it is a wellknown fact that the wild swan cygnus ferus also called the 'whistling swan' when on the wing emits a shrill tone which however harsh it may sound if heard near produces a pleasant effect when emanating from a large flock high in the air it is heard in a variety of pitches of sound increasing or diminishing in loudness according to the movement of the birds and to the current of the air colonel hawker 2 says the only note which i ever heard the wild swan make in winter is his wellknown 'whoop'

tasselgentle the male of the goshawk was so called on account of its tractable disposition and the facility with which it was tamed it occurs in romeo and juliet ii 2

o for a falconer's voice
to lure this tasselgentle back again

spenser in his faerie queene bk iii iv 49 says

having far off espied a tasselgent
which after her his nimble wings doth straine

this species of hawk was also commonly called a falcongentle on account of her familiar courteous disposition

turkeythis bird so popular with us at christmastide is mentioned in 1 henry iv ii 1 where the first carrier saysgod's body the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved this however is an anachronism on the part of shakespeare as the turkey was unknown in this country until the reign of henry viii according to a rhyme written in 1525 commemorating the introduction of this bird we are told how

turkies carps hoppes piccarell and beere
came into england all in one yeare

the turkey is again mentioned by shakespeare in 'twelfth night' ii 5 where fabian says of malvoliocontemplation makes a rare turkeycock of him how he jets under his advanced plumes

vulturein several passages shakespeare has introduced most forcibly this bird to deepen the beauty of some of his exquisite passages thus king lear ii 4 when complaining of the unkindness of a daughter bitterly exclaims

o regan she hath tied
sharptoothd unkindness like a vulture here

what too can be more graphic than the expression of tamora in titus andronicus v 2

i am revenge sent from the infernal kingdom
to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind

equally forcible too are pistol's words in the merry wives of windsor i 3

let vultures gripe thy guts

johnson considers that the vulture of sedition in 2 henry vi iv 3 is in allusion to the tale of prometheus but of this there is a decided uncertainty

wagtailin king lear ii 2 kent says

spare my grey beard you wagtail

the word being used in an opprobrious sense to signify an officious person

woodcockin several passages this bird is used to denote a fool or silly person as in taming of the shrew i 2

o this woodcock what an ass it is

and again in much ado about nothing v 1 where claudio alluding to the plot against benedick says

shall i not find a woodcock too

in love's labour's lost iv 3 biron says

o heavens i have my wish
duncan's transformed four woodcocks in a dish

the woodcock has generally been proverbial as a foolish birdperhaps because it is easily caught in springes or nets thus the popular phrase springes to catch woodcocks meant arts to entrap simplicity as in hamlet i 3

aye springes to catch woodcocks

a similar expression occurs in beaumont and fletcher's loyal subject iv 4

go like a woodcock
and thrust your neck i th noose

it seems says nares that woodcocks are now grown wiser by time for we do not now hear of their being so easily caught if they were sometimes said to be without brains it was only founded on their character certainly not on any examination of the fact formerly one of the terms for twilight was cockshut time because the net in which cocks ie woodcocks were shut in during the twilight was called a cockshut it appears that a large net was stretched across a glade and so suspended upon poles as to be easily drawn together thus in richard iii v 3 ratcliff says

thomas the earl of surrey and himself
much about cockshut time from troop to troop
went through the army cheering up the soldiers

in ben jonson's masque of gypsies we read

mistress this is only spite
for you would not yesternight
kiss him in the cockshut light

sometimes it was erroneously written cockshoot come come away then a fine cockshoot evening in the two noble kinsmen iv i we find the term cocklight

wrenthe diminutive character of this bird is noticed in a midsummer night's dream iii 1 song

the wren with little quill


lady macbeth iv 2 says

the poor wren
the most diminutive of birds will fight
her young ones in her nest against the owl

considering too that as many as sixteen young ones have been found in this little bird's nest we can say with grahame in his poem on the birds of scotland

but now behold the greatest of this train
of miracles stupendously minute
the numerous progeny claimant for food
supplied by two small bills and feeble wings
of narrow range supplieday duly fed
fed in the dark and yet not one forgot

the epithet poor applied to the wren by lady macbeth was certainly appropriate in days gone by when we recollect how it was cruelly hunted in ireland on st stephen's daya practice which prevailed also in the isle of manembed"

stuck in the jet wash
a bad trip i couldn't get off
maybe i bit off more than i could chew
overhead of the aqua blue
fall to your knees bring on the rapture
blessed be the boys time can't capture
on film or between the sheets
i always fall from your window to the pitch black street
and with the black banners raised
as the crooked smiles fade
former heroes who quit too late
who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

i'd do it all again
i think you're my best friend
don't you know that the kids aren't al kids aren't alright
i'll be yours
when it rains it pours
stay thirsty like before
don't you know that the kids aren't al kids aren't alright

verse 2
i'm not passive but aggressive
take note it's not impressive
empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
on my bedroom floor
we put your curse in reverse
and it's our time now if you want it to be
maul the world like the carnival bear set free
and your love is anemic and i can't believe
that you couldn't see it coming from me
and i still feel that rush in my veins
it twists my head just a bit to think
all those people in those old photographs i've seen are dead

his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words won't come out
he's choking how everybody's joking now
the clock's run out time's up over blaow
snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope
there goes rabbit he choked he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy no he won't have it he knows
his whole back's to these ropes it don't matter he's dope
he knows that but he's broke he's so stagnant he knows
when he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's
back to the lab again yo this old rhapsody
better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him and

we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
i'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air
see the lights see the party the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say hello
little did i know

prechorus
that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you please don't go and i said

chorus
romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes

verse 2
so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while oh oh

wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town

and i said romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

you said you livin' up north when you comin' to the a
you said you need to find a crib well tell me where you wanna stay
i know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace
i'm tired of looking at your pictures wanna be up in your face
i wanna dance with you i wanna laugh i wanna sing
take you on the road have you rockin' on my bling
don't know if you're the one but if you are you'll get a ring
that's later down the line don't wanna rush these types of things
i'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first
as you whip the coupe around just use the seat belt first
new shoes new clothes and a chanel purse
vacaying in the hamptons got a lazy curse

left a small town never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of falling
wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

prechorus
i say can you believe it
as we're lyin' on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes yes i can see it now

chorus
do you remember we were sittin' there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine

verse 2
flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
and there's a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded
you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes yes this is what i thought about

chorus
do you remember we were sittin' there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine

postchorus
ohoh ohoh

bridge
and i remember that fight 230am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
'cause that's all i've ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said i'll never leave you alone
chorus
you said i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine

postchorus
hold on make it last
hold on never turn back
hold on you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter make it last

you hold in your hands one the great books of our century fnord
some great books are recognized at once with a fusilade of critical huzzahs and gonfolons like joyce's ulysses others appear almost furtively and are only discovered 50 years later like moby dick or mendel's great essay on genetics the principia discordia entered our spacetime continuum almost as unobtrusively as a catburglar creeping over a windowsill

in 1968 virtually nobody had heard of this wonderful book in 1970 hundreds of people coast to coast were talking about it and asking the identity of the mysterious author malaclypse the younger rumors swept across the continent from new york to los angeles from seattle to st joe malaclypse was actually alan watts one heard no said another legend  the principia was actually the work of the sufi order a third very intriguing myth held that malaclypse was a penname for richard m nixon who had allegedly composed the principia during a few moments of lucidity i enjoyed each of these yarns and did my part to help spread them i was also careful never to contradict the occasional rumors that i had actually written the whole thing myself during an acid trip

the legendry the mystery the cult grew slowly by the mid1970's thousands of people some as far off as hong kong and australia were talking about the principia and since the original was out of print by then xerox copies were beginning to circulate here and there

when the illuminatus trilogy appeared in 1975 my coauthor bob shea and i both received hundreds of letters from people intrigued by the quotes from the principia with which we had decorated the heads of several chapters many who had already heard of the principia or seen copies asked if shea and i had written it or if we had copies available others wrote to ask if it were real or just something we had invented the way hp lovecraft invented the necronomicon we answered according to our moods sometimes telling the truth sometimes spreading the most godawful lies and myths we could devise fnord

why not we felt that this book was a true classic literatus immortalis and since the alleged intelligentsia had not yet discovered it the best way to keep its legend alive was to encourage the mythology and the controversy about it increasingly people wrote to ask me if timothy leary had written it and i almost always told them he had except on fridays when i am more whimsical in which case i told them it had been transmitted by a canine intelligence  vast cool and unsympathic  from the dog star sirius

now at last the truth can be told

actually the principia is the work of a timetravelling anthropologist from the 23rd century he is currently passing among us as a computer specialist bon vivant and philosopher named gregory hill he has also translated several volumes of etruscan erotic poetry under another penname and in the 18th century was the mysterious man in black who gave jefferson the design for the great seal of the united states

i have it on good authority that he is one of the most accomplished timetravelers in the galaxy and has visited earth many times in the past using such coveridentities as zeno of elias emperor norton count cagliostro guilliame of aquaitaine etc whenever i question him about this he grows very evasive and attempts to persuade me that he is actually just another 20th century earthman and that all my ideas about his extra terrrestrial and extratemporal origin and delusions hah i am not that easily deceived after all a timetravelling anthropologist would say just that so that he could observe us without his presense causing cultureshock

i understand that he has consented to write an afterward to this edition he'll probably contradict everything i've told you but don't believe a word he says fnord he is a master of the deadpan puton the plausible satire the philosophical legpull and all the branches of guerilla ontology

for full benefit to the head this book should be read in conjunction with the illuminoids by neal wilgus sun press albuquerque nm and zen without zen masters by camden benares andor press berkeley california we are operating on many levels here as ken kesey used to say

in conclusion there is no conclusion things go on as they always have getting weirder all the time

the pentabarf was discovered by the hermit apostle zarathud in the fifth year of the caterpillar he found them carved in gilded stone while building a sun deck for his cave but their import was lost for they were written in a mysterious cypher however after 10 weeks  11 hours of intensive scrutiny he discerned that the message could be read by standing on his head and viewing it upside down

he did just as the zen master
instructed his meditation was frequently interrupted by worries  he
worried whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would fall from the
second floor bathroom to join the pipes and other trash he was sitting on
he worried how would he know when the moon rose on the next night  he
worried about what the people who walked through the room said about him

his worrying and meditation were disturbed when as if in a test of his
faith ordure fell from the second floor onto him  at that time two people
walked into the room  the first asked the second who the man was sitting
there was  the second replied some say he is a holy man others say he is

the birth of the erisian movement

the revelation

just prior to the decade of the nineteensixties when sputnik was alone and new and about the time that ken kesey took his first acid trip as a medical volunteer before underground newspapers viet nam and talk of a second american revolution in the comparative quiet of the late nineteen fifties just before the idea of renaissance became relevant
two young californians known later as omar ravenhurst and malaclypse the younger were indulging in their habit of sipping coffee at an allnight bowling alley and generally solving the world's problems this particular evening the main subject of discussion was discord and they were complaining to each other of the personal confusion they felt in their respective lives solve the problem of discord said one and all other problems will vanish indeed said the other chaos and strife are the roots of all confusion

first i must sprinkle you with fairy dust

suddenly the place became devoid of light then an utter silence enveloped them and a great stillness was felt then came a blinding flash of intense light as though their very psyches had gone nova then vision returned
the two were dazed and neither moved nor spoke for several minutes they looked around and saw that the bowlers were frozen like statues in a variety of comic positions and that a bowling ball was steadfastly anchored to the floor only inches from the pins that it had been sent to scatter the two looked at each other totally unable to account for the phenomenon the condition was one of suspension and one noticed that the clock had stopped

marginalia no girdle ever cured a pregnancy

there walked into the room a chimpanzee shaggy and grey about the muzzle yet upright to his full five feet and poised with natural majesty he carried a scroll and walked to the young men

gentlemen he said why does pickering's moon go about in reverse orbit gentlemen there are nipples on your chests do you give milk and what pray tell gentlemen is to be done about heisenberg's law he paused somebody had to put all of this confusion here

and with that he revealed his scroll it was a diagram like a yin yang with a pentagon on one side and an apple on the other and then he exploded and the two lost consciousness

eris  goddess of chaos discord  confusion

they awoke to the sound of pins clattering and found the bowlers engaged in their game and the waitress busy with making coffee it was apparant that their experience had been private
they discussed their strange encounter and reconstructed from memory the chimpanzee's diagram over the next five days they searched libraries to find the significance of it but were disappointed to uncover only references to taoism the korean flag and technocracy it was not until they traced the greek writing on the apple that they discovered the ancient goddess known to the greeks as eris and to the romans as discordia this was on the fifth night and when they slept that night each had a vivid dream of a splendid woman whose eyes were as soft as feather and as deep as eternity itself and whose body was the spectacular dance of atoms and universes pyrotechnics of pure energy formed her flowing hair and rainbows manifested and dissolved as she spoke in a warm and gentle voice

i have come to tell you that you are free many ages ago my consciousness left man that he might develop himself i return to find this development approaching completion but hindered by fear and by misunderstanding
you have built for yourselves psychic suits of armor and clad in them your vision is restricted your movements are clumsy and painful your skin is bruised and your spirit is broiled in the sun

i am chaos i am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms i am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy i am chaos i am alive and i tell you that you are free

during the next months they studied philosophies and theologies and learned that eris or discordia was primarily feared by the ancients as being disruptive indeed the very concept of chaos was still considered equivalent to strife and treated as a negative no wonder things are all screwed up they concluded they have got it all backwards they found that the principle of disorder was every much as significant as the principle of order

with this in mind they studied the strange yinyang during a meditation one afternoon a voice came to them

it is called the sacred chao i appoint you keepers of it therein you will find anything you like speak of me as discord to show contrast to the pentagon tell constricted mankind that there are no rules unless they choose to invent rules keep close the words of syadasti 'tis an ill wind that blows no minds and remember that there is no tyranny in the state of confusion for further information consult your pineal gland

what is this mumbled one to the other a religion based on the goddess of confusion it is utter madness

and with those words each looked at the other in absolute awe omar began to giggle mal began to laugh omar began to jump up and down mal was hooting and hollering to beat all hell and amid squeals of mirth and with tears on their cheeks each appointed the other to be high priest of his own madness and together they declared themselves to be a society of discordia for what ever that may turn out to be

it is my firm belief that it is a mistake
to hold firm beliefs
the classical greeks were not influenced by the classical greeks
do not circulate
what we know about eris not much

the romans left a likeness of her for posterityshe was shown as a grotesque woman with a pale and ghastly look her eyes afire her garment ripped and torn and as concealing a dagger in her bosom actually most women look pale and ghastly when concealing a chilly dagger in their bosoms
her geneology is from the greeks and is utterly confused either she was the twin of ares and the daughter of zeus and hera or she was the daughter of nyx goddess of night who was either the daughter or wife of chaos or both and nyx's brother erebus and whose brothers and sisters include death doom mockery and friendship and that she begat forgetfullness quarrels lies and a bunch of gods and goddesses like that

one day mal2 consulted his pineal gland and asked eris if she really created all of those terrible things she told him that she had always liked the old greeks but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters they were she added victims of indigestion you know

suffice it to say that eris is not hateful or malicious but she is mischievous and does get a little bitchy at times

the pineal gland is where each and every one of us can talk to eris if you have trouble activating your pineal then try the appendix which does almost as well reference dogma i metaphysics 3 the indoctrine of the pineal gland

the inside story

the law of fives

the law of fives is one of the oldest erisian mysterees it was first revealed to good lord omar and is one of the great contributions to come from the hidden temple of the happy jesus
poee subscribes to the law of fives of omar's sect and poee also recognizes the holy 23 235 that is incorporated by episkopos dr mordecai malignatus kns into his discordian sect the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria

the law of fives states simply that all things happen in fives or are divisible by or are multiples of five or are somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to 5

the law of fives is never wrong

in the erisian archives is an old memo from omar to mal2 i find the law of fives to be more and more manifest the harder i look

please do not use this
document as toilet tissue

the nagas of upper burma say that the sun

 john kenneth galbraith
the myth of the apple of discord

it seems that zeus was preparing a wedding banquet for peleus and thetis and did not want to invite eris because of her reputation as a trouble maker
this made eris angry and so she fashioned an apple of pure gold and inscribed upon it kallisti to the prettiest one and on the day of the fete she rolled it into the banquet hall and then left to be alone and joyously partake of a hot dog

now three of the invited goddesses athena hera and aphrodite each immediately claimed it to belong to herself because of the inscription and they started fighting and they started throwing punch all over the place and everything

finally zeus calmed things down and declared that an arbitrator must be selected which was a reasonable suggestion and all agreed he sent them to a shepherd of troy whose name was paris because his mother had had a lot of gaul and had married a frenchman but each of the sneaky goddesses tried to outwit the others by going early and offering a bribe to paris

athena offered him heroic war victories hera offered him great wealth and aphrodite offered him the most beautiful woman on earth being a healthy young trojan lad paris promptly accepted aphrodite's bribe and she got the apple and he got screwed

as she had promised she maneuvered earthly happenings so that paris could have helen the helen then living with her husband menelaus king of sparta anyway everyone knows that the trojan war followed when sparta demanded their queen back and that the trojan war is said to be the first war among men

and so we suffer because of the original snub and so a discordian is to partake of no hot dog buns

do you believe that

 this is called the doctrine of the original snub
 there is historic disagreement concerning whether this apple was of metallic gold or acapulco

 actually there were five goddesses but the greeks did not know the law of fives

6 an age of bureaucracy is an imperial age in which things mature in which confusion becomes entrenched and during which balanced balance or stagnation is attained

7 an age of disorder or an aftermath is an apocalyptic period of transition back to chaos through the screen of oblivion into which the age passeth finally these are ages of unbalanced unbalance

 the five fingered hand of eris 

the official symbol of poee is here illustrated it may be this or any similar device to represent two opposing arrows converging into a common point it may be vertical horizontal or else such and it may be elaborated or simplified as desired
the esoteric name for this symbol is the five fingered hand of eris commonly shortened to the hand

  

  
note in the lore of western magic the  is taken to symbolize horns especially the horns of satan or of diabolical beasties the five fingered hand of eris however is not intended to be taken as satanic for the horns are supported by another set of inverted horns or maybe it is walrus tusks i don't know what it is to tell the truth

poee pronounced poee is an acronym for the paratheoanametamystikhood of eris esoteric the first part can be taken to mean equivalent deity reversity beyondmystique we are not really esoteric it's just that nobody pays much attention to us
my high reverence malaclypse the younger ab dd ksc is the high priest of poee and poee is grounded in his episkopotic revelations of the goddess he is called the omnibenevolent polyfather of virginity in gold

the poee head temple is the joshua norton cabal of the discordian society which is located in mal2's pineal gland and can be found by temporally and spacially locating the rest of mal2

poee has no treasury no bylaws no articles no guides save mal2's pineal gland and has only one scruplewhich mal2 keeps on his key chain

poee has not registered incorporated or otherwise chartered with the state and so the state does not recognize poee or poee ordinations which is only fair because poee does not recognize the state

poee  it's priests

if you like erisianism as it is presented according to mal2 then you may wish to from your own poee cabal as a poee priest and you can go do a bunch of poee priestly things a poee cabal is exactly what you think it is
the high priest makes no demands on his priests though he does rather expect good will of them the office of the polyfather is point not to teach once in a while he even listens

should you find that your own revelations of the goddess become substantially different that the revelations of mal2 then perhaps the goddess has plans for you as an episkopos and you might consider creating your own sect from scratch unhindered episkoposes are not competing with each other and they are all poee priests anyway as soon as i locate them the point is that episkoposes are developing separate paths to the erisian mountain top see the section discordian society

ordination as a poee priest

there are no particular qualifications for ordination because if you want to be a poee priest then you must undoubtedly qualify who could possibly know better than you whether or not you should be ordained
an ordained poee priest or priestess is defined as one who holds an ordination certificate from the office of the polyfather

1 the priests and four brothers are arranged in a pentagon with the initiate in the center facing the priests if possible the brothers on the immediate right and left of the priest should be deacons the initiate must be totally naked to demonstrate that he is truly a human being and not something else in disguise like a cabbage or something

2 all persons in the audience and the pentagon excepting the priest assume a squatting position and return to a standing position this is repeated four more times this dance is symbolic of the humility of we erisians

3 the priest begins i complete holy name with mystical titles and degrees designations offices etc ordained priest of the paratheoanametamystikhood of eris esoteric with the authority invested at me by the high priest of it office of the polyfather the house of the rising podge poee head temple do herewith require of ye

are ye a human being and not a cabbage or something
the initiate answers yes
that's too bad do ye wish to better thyself
the initiate answers yes
how stupid are ye willing to become philosophically illuminized
he answers yes
very funny will ye dedicate yeself to the holey erisian movement
the initiate answers probably
then swear ye the following after me
the priest here leads the initiate in a recital of the erisian affirmation
the priest continues then i do here proclaim ye poee disciple name legionnaire of the legion of dynamic discord hail eris hail hail hail yes
4 all present rejoice grandly the new brother opens a large jug of wine and offers it to all who are present
5 the ceremony generally degenerates

mord says that omar says that we are all unicorns anyway

3 and though omar did bid of the collector of garbage in words that were both sweet and bitter to surrender back the cigar box containing the cards designated by the angel as the honest book of truth the collector was to him as one who might be smitten deaf saying only 'gainst the rules y'know

the discordian society

the discordian society has no definition
i sometimes think of it as a disorganization of eris freaks it has been called a guerrilla mind theatre episkopos randomfactor director of purges of our people's underworld movement sect in larchmont prefers the world's greatest association of whateveritisthatweare lady mal thinks of it as a renaissance think tank fang the unwashed wkc won't say you can think of it any way you like

an episkopos of the discordian society is one who prefers total autonomy and creates his own discordian sect as the goddess directs him he speaks for himself and for those that say that they like what he says

the legion of dynamic discord a discordian society legionnaire is one who prefers not to create his own sect

if you want in on the discordian society then declare yourself what you wish do what you like and tell us about it or if you prefer don't

there are no rules anywhere            some episkoposes

the parable of the bitter tea

by rev dr hypocrates magoun pp poee priest okinawa cabal
when hypoc was through meditating with st gulik he went there into the kitchen where he busied himself with preparing the feast and in his endeavor he found that there was some old tea in a pan left standing from the night before when he had in his weakness forgot about its making and had let it sit steeping for 24 hours it was dark and murky and it was hypoc's intention to use this old tea by diluting it with water and again in his weakness chose without further consideration and plunged into the physical labor of the preparations it was then when deeply immersed in the pleasure of that trip he had a sudden loud clear voice in his head saying it is bitter tea that involves you so hypoc heard the voice but the struggle inside intensified and the pattern previously established with the physical laboring and the muscle messages coordinated and unified or perhaps coded continued to exert their influence and hypoc succummed to the pressure and he denied the voice

and again he plunged into the physical orgy and completed the task and lo as the voice had predicted the tea was bitter

the honest book of truth

being a bible of the erisian movement

episkopos lord omar khayyam ravenhurst ksc bull goose of limbo and master pastor of the church invisible of the laughing christ hidden temple of the happy jesus laughing buddha jesus lbj ranch

from the honest book of truth the book of explanations chapter 1

there came one day to lord omar bull goose of limbo a messenger of our lady who told him of a sacred mound wherein was buried an honest book
and the angel of eris bade of the lord go ye hence and dig the truth that ye may come to know it and knowing it spread it and spreading it wallow in it and wallowing in it lie in it and lying in the truth become a poet of the word and a sayer of sayings  an inspiration to all men and a scribe to the gods
so omar went forth to the sacred mound which was to the east of mullah and thereupon he worked digging in the sand for five days and five nights but found no book
at the end of five days and five nights of digging it came to pass that omar was exhausted so he put his shovel to one side and bedded himself down on the sand using as a pillow a golden chest he had uncovered on the first day of his labors
omar slept
on the fifth day of his sleeping lord omar fell into a trance and there came to him in the trance a dream and there came to him in the dream a messenger of our lady who told him of a sacred grove wherein was hidden a golden chest
and the angel of eris bade of the lord go ye hence and lift the stash that ye may come to own it and owning it share it and sharing it love in it and loving in it dwell in it and dwelling in the stash become a poet of the word and a sayer of sayings  an inspiration to all men and a scribe to the gods
but omar lamented saying unto the angel  what is this shit man what care i for the word and sayings what care i for the inspiration of all men wherein does it profit a man to be a scribe to the gods when the scribes of the governments do nothing yet are paid better wages
and lo the angel waxed in anger and omar was stricken to the ground by an invisible hand and did not arise for five days and five nights
and it came to pass that on the fifth night he dreampt and in his dream he had a vision and in this vision there came unto him a messenger of our lady who entrusted to him a rigoletto cigar box containing many filing cards some of them in packs with rubber bands around and upon these cards were sometimes written verses while upon others nothing was written
thereupon the angel commanded to lord take ye this honest book of truth to thine bosom and cherish it carry it forth into the land and lay it before kings of nations and collectors of garbage preach from it unto the righteous that they may renounce their ways and repent
conventional chaos

greyface

in the year 1166 bc a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of greyface got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as he and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted the ways of serious order look at all the order around you he said and from that he deluded honest men to believe that reality was a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known it
it is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that particular time for absolutely no one thought to observe all the disorder around them and conclude just the opposite but anyway greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own

the unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance imbalance causes frustration and frustration causes fear and fear makes for a bad trip man has been on a bad trip for a long time now

it is called the curse of greyface

the book of uterus

from the honest book of truth revealed to lord omar

before the beginning was the nonexistent chao balanced in oblivion by the perfect counterpushpull of the hodge and the podge
whereupon by an act of happenstance the hodge began gradually to overpower the podge  and the primal chaos thereby came to be
so in the beginning was the primal chaos balanced on the edge of oblivion by the perfect counterpullpush of the podge and the hodge
whereupon by the law of negative reversal the podge swiftly underpowered the hodge and everything broke loose
and therein emerged the active force of discord the subtle manifestation of the nonexistent chao to guide everything along the path back to oblivion  that it might not become lost among precepts of order in the region of thud
forasmuch as it was active the force of discord entered the state of confusion wherein it copulated with the queen and begat eris our lady of discord and gross manifestation of the nonexistent chao
and under eris confusion became established and was hence called bureaucracy while over bureaucracy eris became established and was hence called discordia
by the by it came to pass that the establishment of bureaucracy perished in a paper shortage
thus it was in accord with the law of laws
during and after the fall of the establishment of bureaucracy was the aftermath an age of disorder in which calculation computations and reckonings were put away by the children of eris in acceptance and preparation for the return to oblivion to be followed by a repetition of the universal absurdity moreover of itself the coming of aftermath waseth a resurrection of the freedomflowing chaos hail eris
herein was set into motion the eristic pattern which would repeat itself five times over seventythree times after which nothing would happen
  this doctrine should not be confused with dogma iii  history 6 historic cycles which states that social progress occurs in five cycles the first three the tricycle of which are thesis antithesis and parenthesis and the last two the bicycle of which are consternation and moral warptitude

 the law of negative reversal states that if something does not happen then the exact opposite will happen only in exactly the opposite manner from that in which it did not happen

note it is from this text from the book of uterus that poee has based its erisian calendar with the year divided into 5 seasons of 73 days each each of the five apostles of eris has patronage over one season a chart of the seasons patrons days of the week holydays and a perpetual gregorian converter is included in this edition of principia

the five orders of discordia them

gen pandaemonium commanding

the seeds of the orders of discordia were planted by greyface into his early disciples they form the skeleton of the aneristic movement which over emphasizes the principle of order and is antagonistic to the necessary compliment the principle of disorder the orders are composed of persons all hung up on authority security and control ie they are blinded by the aneristic illusion they do not know that they belong to orders of discordia but we know
the military order of the knights of the five sided temple this is for all the soldiers and bureaucrats of the world
the political order of the party for war on evil this is reserved for lawmakers censors and like ilk
the academic order of the hemlock fellowship they commonly inhabit schools and universities and dominate many of them
the social order of the citizens committee for concerned citizens this is mostly a grassroots version of the more professional military political academic and sacred orders
the sacred order of the defamation league not much is known about the dl but they are very ancient and quite possibly were founded by greyface himself it is known that they now have absolute domination over all organized churches in the world it is also believed that they have been costuming cabbages and passing them off as human beings
a person belonging to one or more order is just as likely to carry a flag of the counterestablishment as the flag of the establishment just as long as it is a flag

go to your leftright

the following is quoted from bergan evans
on norbert weiner nuclear physicist
the second concept wiener has to establish is that of entropy probability is a mathematical concept coming from statistics entropy comes from physics it is the assertion established logically and experimentally that the universe by its nature is running down moving toward a state of inert uniformity devoid of form matter hierarchy or differentiation
that is in any given situation less organization more chaos is overwhelmingly more probable than tighter organization or more order

the tendency for entropy to increase in isolated systems is expressed in the second law of thermodynamics perhaps the most pessimistic and amoral formulation in all human thought

it applies however to a closed system to something that is an isolated whole not just a part within such systems there may be parts which draw their energy from the whole that are moving at least temporarily in the opposite direction in them order is increasing and chaos is diminishing

the whirlpools that swirl in a direction opposed to the main current are called enclaves and one of them is life especially human life which in a universe moving inexorably towards chaos moves towards increased order

one day zarathud took his students to a pleasant pasture and there he confronted the sacred chao while she was contentedly grazing

tell me you dumb beast demanded the priest in his commanding voice why don't you do something worthwhile what is your purpose in life anyway

the sacred chao is the key to illumination devised by the apostle hung mung in ancient china it was modified and popularized by the taoists and is sometimes called the yinyang the sacred chao is not the yinyang of the taoists it is the hodgepodge of the erisians and instead of a podge spot on the hodge side it has a pentagon which symbolizes the aneristic principle and instead of a hodge spot on the podge side it depicts the golden apple of discordia to symbolize the eristic principle
the sacred chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone need ever know about absolutely anything and more it even symbolizes everything not worth knowing depicted by the empty space surrounding the hodgepodge

here follows some psychometaphysics

if you are not hot for philosophy best just to skip it
the aneristic principle is that of apparent order the eristic principle is that of apparent disorder both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos which is a level deeper that is the level of distinction making

with our concept making apparatus called mind we look at reality through the ideasaboutreality which our cultures give us the ideasabout reality are mistakenly labeled reality and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people especially other cultures see reality differently it is only the ideasaboutreality which differ real capitalt true reality is a level deeper that is the level of concept

we look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids concepts different philosophies use different grids a culture is a group of people with rather similar grids through a window we view chaos and relate it to the points on our grid and thereby understand it the order is in the grid that is the aneristic principle

western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will hence say unenlightened westerners be true this is illusory it is what we erisians call the aneristic illusion some grids can be more useful than others some more beautiful than others some more pleasant than others etc but none can be more true than any other

disorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid but like relation norelation is a concept male like female is an idea about sex to say that maleness is absence of femaleness or vice versa is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary the artificial concept of norelation is the eristic principle

the belief that order is true and disorder is false or somehow wrong is the aneristic illusion to say the same of disorder is the eristic illusion

the point is that littlet truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment and that capitalt truth metaphysical reality is irrelevant to grids entirely pick a grid and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered pick another grid and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered

reality is the original rorschach

verily so much for all that


the words of the foolish and those of the wise
are not far apart in discordian eyes
hbt the book of advise 21

the podge of the sacred chao is symbolized as the golden apple of discordia which represents the eristic principle of disorder the writing on it kallisti is greek for to the prettiest one and refers to an old myth about the goddess but the greeks had only a limited understanding of disorder and thought it to be a negative principle
the pentagon represents the aneristic principle of order and symbolizes the hodge the pentagon has several references for one it can be taken to represent geometry one of the earliest studies of formal order to reach elaborate development for another it specifically accords with the law of fives


the truth is five but men have only one name for it
patamunzo lingananda
it is also the shape of the united states military headquarters the pentagon building a most pregnant manifestation of straightjacket order resting on a firm foundation of chaos and constantly erupting into dazzling disorder and this building is one of our more cherished erisian shrines also it so happens that in times of medieval magic the pentagon was the generic symbol for werewolves but this reference is not particularly intended and it should be noted that the erisian movement does not discriminate against werewolves our membership roster is open to persons of all races national origins and hobbies


 the greek geometrician pythagoras however was not a typical aneristic personality he was what we call an exploded aneristic and an avatar we call him archangle pythagoras

brunswick shrine

in the los angeles suburb of whittier there lives a bowling alley and within this very place in the year of our lady of discord 3125 1959 eris revealed herself to the golden apple corps for the first time
in honor of this incredible event this holy place is revered as a shrine by all erisians once every five years the golden apple corps plans a pilgrimage to brunswick shrine as an act of devotion and therein to partake of no hot dog buns and ruminate a bit about it all

it is written that when the corps returns to the shrine for the fifth time five times over than shall the world come to an end

impending doom has arrived

and five days prior to this occasion the apostle the elder
malaclypse shall walk the streets of whittier bearing a sign
for all literates to read thereof doom as a warning of
forthcoming doom to all men impending and he shall signal
this event by seeking the poor and distributing to them precious
mao buttons and whittier shall be known as the region of thud
for these five days
as a public service to all mankind and civilization in general and to us in particular the golden apple corps has concluded that planning such a pilgrimage is sufficient and that it is prudent to never get around to actually going

do these 5 pebbles really form a pentagon
note they were pebbles originallytry doing ascii pebbles dtc those biased by the aneristic illusion would say yes those biased by the eristic illusion would say no crisscross them and it is a star

an illuminated mind can see all of these yet he does not insist that any one is really true or that none at all is true stars and pentagons and disorder are all his creations and he may do with them as he wishes indeed even so the concept of number 5

the real reality is there but everything you know about it is in your mind and yours to do with as you like conceptualization is art and you are the artist

your acute observation that eris spelled backwards is sire and your inference to the effect that there is sexual symbolism here have brought me to some observations of my own

eris spelled forepartaftwards is rise and spelled inside out is reis which is a unit of money albeit portugesebrazilian and no longer in use from this it may be concluded that eris has usurped eros god of erotic love in the eyes of those who read backwards which obviously made eros sore then she apparently embezzeled the olympian treasury and went to brazil whereupon she opened a chain of whorehouses which certainly would get a rise from the male population i figure it to be this in particular because madam reads the same forwards and backwards and further it is a term of great respect similar to sire

and so thank you for your insight it may well be the clue to the mystery of just where eris has been fucking around for 3125 years

safeguard this letter it may be an important document

form no odd iibii137dvvm3134
dogma iii  history 2 cosmogony

which is not the same as
dogma i  metaphysics 2 cosmology book of uterus

in the beginning there was void who had two daughters one the smaller was that of being named eris and one the larger was of non being named aneris to this day the fundamental truth that aneris is the larger is apparent to all who compare the great number of things that do not exist with the comparatively small number of things that do exist
eris had been born pregnant and after 55 years goddesses have an unusually long gestation period longer even than elephants her pregnancy bore the fruits of many things these things were composed of the five basic elements sweet boom pungent prickle and orange aneris however had been created sterile when she saw eris enjoying herself so greatly with all of the existent things she had borne aneris became jealous and finally one day she stole some existent things and changed them into non existent things and claimed them as her own children this deeply hurt eris who felt that her sister was unjust being so much larger anyway to deny her her small joy and so she made herself swell again to bear more things and she swore that no matter how many of her begotten that aneris would steal she would beget more and in return aneris swore that no matter how many existent things eris brought forth she would eventually find them and turn them into nonexistent things for her own and to this day things appear and disappear in this very manner

at first the things brought forth by eris were in a state of chaos and went in every which way but by the by she began playing with them and ordered some of them just to see what would happen some pretty things arose from this play and for the next five zillion years she amused herself by creating order and so she grouped some things with others and some groups with others and big groups with little groups and all combinations until she had many grand schemes which delighted her

engrossed in establishing order she finally one day noticed disorder previously not apparent because everything was chaos there were many ways in which chaos was ordered and many ways in which it was not

hah she thought here shall be a new game

and she taught order and disorder to play with each other in contest games and to take turns amusing each other she named the side of disorder after herself eristic because being is anarchic and then in a mood of sympathy for her lonely sister she named the other side aneristic which flattered aneris and smoothed the friction a little that was between them

now all of this time void was somewhat disturbed he felt unsatisfied for he had created only physical existence and physical non existence and had neglected the spiritual as he contemplated this a great quiet was caused and he went into a state of deep sleep which lasted for 5 eras at the end of this ordeal he begat a brother to eris and aneris that of spirituality who had no name at all

when the sisters heard this they both confronted void and pleaded that he not forget them his first born and so void decreed thus

that this brother having no form was to reside with aneris in nonbeing and then to leave her and so that he might play with order and disorder reside with eris in being but eris became filled with sorrow when she heard this and then began to weep

why are you despondent demanded void your new brother will have his share with you but father aneris and i have been arguing and she will take him from me when she discovers him and cause him to return to non being i seereplied void then i decree the following

when your brother leaves the residence of being he shall not reside again in nonbeing but shall return to me void from whence he came you girls may bicker as you wish but my son is your brother and we are all of myself

and so it is that we as men do not exist until we do and then it is that we play with our world of existent things and order and disorder them and so it shall be that nonexistence shall take us back from existence and that nameless spirituality shall return to void like a tired child home from a very wild circus

on occultism

magicians especially since the gnostic and the quabala influences have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites goodevil positivenegative malefemale etc but due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earthplane opposites orderdisorder and serioushumorous
magicians and progeny the scientists have always taken themselves and their subject in an orderly and sober manner thereby disregarding an essential metaphysical balance when magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable truth and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavours then they will be able to pursue their art with a lighter heart and perhaps gain a clearer understanding of it and therefore gain more effective magic chaos is energy

this is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought and poee is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since solomon

the eminent 16th century mathemetician cardan so detested luther that he altered luther's birthdate to give him an unfavorable horoscope
the theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names it is always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite their cards assume the contrary let n be the even number of persons and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to n1 in such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the table if a delegate d originally sits down to a place card p then the table must be rotated r steps before he is correctly seated where rpd unless this is negative in which case rpdn the collection of values of d and of p for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to n1each taken once but so also is the collection of values of r or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time summing the above equations one for each delegate gives ssnk where k is an integer and snn12 the sum of the integers from 0 to n1 it follows that n2k1 an odd number this contradicts the original assumption

the curse of greyface and the introduction of negativism

to choose order over disorder or disorder over order is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive but to choose the creative over the destructive is an allcreative trip composed of both order and disorder to accomplish this one need only accept creative disorder along with and equal to creative order and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder
the curse of greyface included the division of life into orderdisorder as the essential positivenegative polarity instead of building a game foundation with creativedestructive as the essential positivenegative he has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder civilization reflects this unfortunate division


order           disorder

erisian magic ritual  the turkey curse

revealed by the apostle dr van van mojo as a specific counter to the evil
curse of greyface the turkey curse is here passed on to erisians everywhere
for their just protection

the turkey curse works  it is firmly grounded on the fact that greyface and
his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a
timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation
the turkey curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes
and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting like a poet
working out word rhythms it will prove harmless or at worst simply
annoying  it is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes
although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes
into a misguided eristic setting  in this instance it would be the
responsibility of the erisian magician to manufacture the positive
vibrations if results are to be achieved  caution all magic is powerful
and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician  this
ritual if misused can backfire  positive motivation is essential for
selfprotection

to perform the turkey curse

take a foot stance as if you were john l sullivan preparing for fisticuffs
face the particular greyfaced you wish to shortcircuit or towards the
direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize
begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your
hands as though you were mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess  chant loudly
and clearly
gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble
the results will be instantly apparent



a primer for erisian evangelists by lord omar

the socratic approach is most successful when confronting the
ignorant  the socratic approach is what you call starting an argument by
asking questions  you approach the innocent and simply ask did you know
that god's name is eris and that he is a girl  if he should answer yes
then he probably is a fellow erisian and so you can forget it  if he says
no then quickly proceed to
the blind assertion and say well he is a girl and his name is
eris  shrewedly observe if the subject is convinced  if he is swear him
into the legion of dynamic discord before he changes his mind  if he does
not appear convinced then proceed to
the faith bit  but you must have faith  all is lost without
faith  i sure feel sorry for you if you don't have faith  and then add
the argument by fear and in an ominous voice ask do you know what
happens to those who deny goddess  if he hesitates don't tell him that he
will surely be reincarnated as a precious mao button and distributed to the
poor in the region of thud which would be a mean thing to say just shake
your head sadly and while wiping a tear from your eye go to
the first clause ploy wherein you point to all of the discord and
confusion in the world and exclaim well who the hell do you think did all
of this wise guy  if he says nobody just impersonal forces then
quickly respond with
the argument by semantical gymnastics and say that he is absolutely
right and that those impersonal forces are female and that her name is
eris  if he wonder of wonders still remains obstinate then finally
resort to
the figurative symbolism dodge and confide that sophisticated people
like himself recognize that eris is a figurative symbol for an ineffable
metaphysical reality and that the erisian movement is really more like a
poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a precious
mao button and distributed to the poor in the region of thud if he does not
get hip  then put him on your mailing list


sink

a game

by ala hera el ns rayville apple panthers

sink is played by discordians and people of much ilk

purpose to sink object or an object or a thing
in water or mud or anything you can sink something in

rules sinking is allowd in any manner  to date ten pound chunks of mud
were used to sink a tobacco can  it is preferable to have a pit of water or
a hole to drop things in  but rivers  bays  gulfs  i dare say even
oceans can be used

turns are taken thusly  who somever gets the junk up and in the air first

duty  it shall be the duty of all persons playing sink to help find more
objects to sink once one object is sunk

upon sinking  the sinked shall yell i sank it or something equally as
thoughtful

naming of objects is some times desirable  the object is named by the
finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance i sunk

dear brother mal2

in response to your request for unclassified agitprop to be inserted
in the new edition of principia hope the following will be of use  and
please stop bothering us with your incessant letters

episkopos mordecai keeper of the notary sojac informs me that you
are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have been
fully established in atlantis circa 18000 bc under kull the galley
slave who ascended to the throne of valusia  revived by pelias of koth
circa 10000 bc  possibly it was he who taught the innerteachings to
conan of cimmeria after conan became king of aquilonia  first brought to
the western hemisphere by conan and taught to mayan priesthood conan is
quetzlcoatl  that was 4 ahua 8 cumhu mayan date  revived by abdul
alhazred in his infamous al azif circa 800 ad  al azif translated into
latin by olaus wormius 1132 ad as the necronomicon  in 1090 ad was
the founding of the ismaelian sect hashishim by hassan i sabbah with
secret teachings based on alhazred pelias and kull  founding of the
illuminated ones of bavaria by adam weishaupt on may 1 1776  he based it
on the others  weishaupt brought it to the united states during the period
that he was impersonating george washington and it was he who was the man
in black who gave the design for the great seal to jefferson in the garden
that night  the illuminated tradition is now of course in the hands of
the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria aisb headquartered here in
the united states

our teachings are not need i remind you available for publication
no harm though in admitting that some of them can be found disguised in
joyce's finnegan's wake burroughs nova express the king james translation
of the holy bible though not the latin or hebrew and the blue book  not
to speak of ben franklin's private papers  but we are still suppressing
those

considering current developmentsyou know the ones i speak ofit
has been decided to reveal a few more of our front organizations  your
publication is timely so mention that in addition to the old fronts like
the masons the rothchild banks and the federal reserve system we now have
significant control of the federal bureau of investigation since hoover
died last year but that is still secret the students for a democratic
society the communist party usa the american anarchist assn the junior
chamber of commerce the black lotus society the republican party the john
dillinger die for you society and the camp fire girls  it is still useful
to continue the sham of the birchers that we are seeking world domination
so do not reveal that political and economic control was generally complete
several generations ago and that we are just playing with the world for a
while until civilization advances sufficiently for phase five

in fact you might still push vennard's the federal reserve hoax
since the babylonian captivity there has existed a determined behindthe
scenes underthetable atheistic satanic antichristian forceworshipers
of mamonwhose undying purpose is world control through the control of
money  july 1 1776 correct that to may 1st vennard can't get anything
right the serpent raised its head in the underground secret society known
as the illuminati founded by adam weishaupt  there is considerable
documentary evidence to prove all revolutions wars depressions strikes
and chaos stem from this source etc etc you know the stuff

the general location of our us hq incidentally has been nearly
exposed and so we will be moving for the first time this century what a
drag  if you want you can reveal that it is located deep in the

part five     the golden secret


nonsense as salvation

the human race will begin solving it's problems on the day that it ceases
taking itself so seriously

to that end poee proposes the countergame of nonsense as salvation
salvation from an ugly and barbarous existence that is the result of taking
order so seriously and so seriously fearing contrary orders and disorder
that games are taken as more important than life rather than taking life as
the art of playing games

to this end we propose that man develop his innate love for disorder and
play with the goddess eris  and know that it is a joyful play and that
thereby can be revoked the curse of greyface

if you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master
sense then each will expose the other for what it is absurdity  from that
moment of illumination a man begins to be free regardless of his
surroundings  he becomes free to play order games and change them at will
he becomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it  he becomes
free to play neither or both  and as the master of his own games he plays
without fear and therefore without frustration and therefore with good
will in his soul and love in his being

and when men become free then mankind will be free
may you be free of the curse of greyface
may the goddess put twinkles in your eyes
may you have the knowledge of a sage
and the wisdom of a child
hail eris                                              t'ai

the last word
the foregoing document was revealed to mal2 by the goddess herself through
many consultations with her within his pineal gland  it is guaranteed to be
the word of goddess  however it is only fair to state that goddess doesn't
always say the same thing to each listener and that other episkoposes are
sometimes told quite different things in their revelations which are also
the word of goddess  consequently if you prefer a discordian sect other
than poee then none of these truths are binding and it is a rotten shame
that you have read all the way down to the very last word


discordian society
dedicated to an advanced
understanding  of the paraphysical
manifestations of everyday chaos

did you know that you have a lopsided pineal gland

well probably you do have one and it's unfortunate because lopsided pineal
glands have perverted the free spirit of man and subverted life into a
frustrating unhappy and hopeless mess

fortunately you have before you a handbook that will show you how to
discover your salvation through eris the goddess of confusion  it will
advise you how to balance your pineal gland and reach spiritual
illumination  and it will teach you how to turn your miserable mess into a
beautiful joyful and splendid one

poee is a bridge from
pisces to aquarius

why are we here                              suppressed knowledge

cut off from jeroboam him that

if you knew knew what the bluebirds sang at you
you would never sing along
cast them out 'cause this is our culture
these new flocks are nothing but vultures

with the person that she told me not to worry about
but it's alright 'cause we're both numb

but it's just life and there's no love

girl you know it doesn't bother me
that i'm not with you
but i hope that i'm on your mind
baby tell me that you thought of me
'cause i thought of you with a girl that i met last night
i don't wanna live in this fake shit
don't want fake love and relations
we don't gotta make love through relationships
but we still fuck and we hate this shit
we still numb but we fakin' it

i've been watchin' you for some time
can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
burning cities and napalm skies
fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
your ocean eyes

when you give me those ocean eyes
i'm scared

fallin' into your ocean eyes
those ocean eyes

i've been walkin' through a world gone blind
can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
careful creature made friends with time
he left her lonely with a diamond mind
and those ocean eyes

so yeah niggas needed caffeine to wake up
i still got haters to this day here's where this shit stops
he said versus chess i died
but i didn't rick fox
nigga we could fight i like scuffles
say the wrong thing i might snuff you
big blade let a knife cut you
carve out his spine 'til it's knot in his back like a tight muscle
this lil' 9 bad ass hell zoom past you
got it under his chin the tools blast you
put his tissues on the ceiling we's fuckin' up the school bathroom
nigga i accepted nitty cause i want all the smoke
to take so many punches the fans yellin'
get off the ropes
nigga you can miss me with that slogan i hold a lot of substance
mohammad ali why get off the ropes if i can dodge the punches
gun butt impair his vision trust ya boy lost
next the glock coma glaucoma and his eye i go first like fuck the coin toss
nigga i'm killin' nitty cause of you
you off from the funeral
is you payin' for it
shoot 'til his blood spill
funny how rum on me but you payin' for it
i'ma kill you
i'ma hurt you on some gang shit
ask what'll happen nigga i will snap yo' neck that's what's crackin' nigga
i will put yo' little daughter in the scope
nah that'll leave me very fucking scarred
i hope she go to jungle gym trip and hit every fuccin' bar
nigga i will fire on you like a crazy ex blazin' tecs
watch you burn nit' turn into ashes
like you born with a silver spoon you ain't even gotta earn it urn nit'
if he shoot i take his grip
you ain't gotta guess
this nigga air and aaron got robbed like the dunk contest
wait the culture said i'ma die
with the fans i couldn't seem to reason
but the fans inception
even in they dreams they sleepin'
i'm leonardo dicaprio i murder fam'
you're fuckin' wildin'
i been a villain this whole time
i had to find myself shutter island
and when i go against a fan favorite y'all try reroutin' me
tellin' me all i gotta do is hang
oh i'ma hangall you motherfuckas that keep doubtin' me
he get close i take his jewels  testin' me
go at him wess i feel like  batman robbin' robin the nigga next to me
you had one job don't be a target
you know that
headshot walmart in his eyes they roll back
playboy ex marks the spot when these tecs come
ain't he on bars of the month
bang you won't be on the next one
i catch him low key
he won't be on the next one
i got the drop him with the damn heat
nigga can't speak
then rum froze i thought liquor can't freeze
but earlier earlier didn't he expect somethin'
in the background but the silencer known for one thing

that sound
nigga these shots for niggas reppin' the quart'
soon as i blast that quarters droppin'
but it sound like i hit his cash app
nigga i will shoot you through the windshield
clip'll blast
after i get the toast of rum we hit the glass
nigga this is my fuckin' spot
they made me wait years for that
rum hit the glass i was supposed to get cheers for that
i will kill you
it's mr it is not fair
i was top tier before i got here

this mind isn't mine who am i to judge
oh i should be fine but it's all too much

verse 1
i get overwhelmed so easily
my anxiety creeps inside of me
makes it hard to breathe
words come over me
feels like i'm somebody else
so just don't get overwhelmed
and youll  make it out
then you'll be just fine
i promise you don't have to worry bout a thing
don't let it break you down
you got me by your side
and when you feel the difference it will be night and day
night and day

bridge
fuck what they think
i'll tell you your fine
when you're with me
i aint letting that slide
fuck what they say
they're no friend of mine
if they keep coming
i ain't letting one by

that's the way it goes
if they ever try to touch you
then just stay at home
that's the way it ends
i'll make sure they never see another day again
these things take time
don't let them get to your head
you let them in your mind
now they're under your bed
they come in easy
but is harder to get
them out
so just don't get overwhelmed

and the next step has me staring at the edge

so haters see me improve just give me a week or two
see when you read the news my bitches all sleepin' nude
my rhyme talent is why my album is fly
your favorite record you gon' put it aside
this that old school shit soundin' good in the ride
and fuck ten i'm only countin' to nine
said this that old school shit soundin' good in the ride
so let's head out to the party i'll drive

chorus
there's a party on fifth ave party on fifth ave
hit me if you tryna go hit me if you tryna go
i can be there in like twenty i'ma honk it and come runnin'
'cause we gotta hit the road we gotta hit the road
make you sure you got a clean shirt clean pants new shoes new shoes
or just hitch a ride there you choose you choose
there's a party on fifth ave tonight
and that's what i'm tryin' to do

bridge
what's goin' on there's a party
hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
homies to the left all the ladies to the right
we came to get down we gon' do that now
my light up shoes on my light up shoes on my light up shoes on
they love the way my kicks flash
this ain't a time to just sit back
'cause there's a party on fifth ave
chorus
there's a party on fifth ave party on fifth ave
hit me if you tryna go hit me if you tryna go
i can be there in like twenty i'ma honk it and come runnin'

put on your war paint

verse 1
you are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
strike a match and i'll burn you to the ground
we are the jackolanterns in july
setting fire to the sky
here here comes this rising tide so come on
put on your war paint
cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
silver clouds with grey linings

prechorus
so we can take the world back from the heartattacked
one maniac at a time we will take it back
you know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
so dance alone to the beat of your heart

chorus
hey young blood doesn't it feel
like our time is running out
i'm going to change you like a remix
then i'll raise you like a phoenix
wearing our vintage misery
no i think it looked a little better on me
i'm going to change you like a remix
then i'll raise you like a phoenix

can you hear me i'm calling you
it's getting hard to see the darkness through
summer just left us with autumn blues
and i'm having a hard time to follow through

but when they photoshop and auto tune
emotions off take out all the truth
we go for that dream and chase that feeling cause
when we were kids that was all we knew hey

always felt this adrenaline rush
in my soul that's lead me to kicking up dust
doctor prescribing medicine that
he said would keep me from giving a fuck w'the fuck

just keep on living it up
when they push you down just turn everything up
what am i supposed to be giving this up
all the things that made me you're kidding me huh

but if you close your eyes
does it almost feel like nothing changed at all
and if you close your eyes

look i was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
but i'm only going to get this one chance six minutes six minutes
something's wrong i can feel it six minutes slim shady you're on
just a feeling i've got like something's about to happen but i don't know what

all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
they said i rap like a robot so call me rapbot
verse 1
but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when i halfcock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin' and a killin' off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables skillaholic kill 'em all with
this flippity dippityhippity hiphop
you don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
with this rappity brat packin' a mac in the back of the ac'
backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack
and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin' that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs
feel my wrath of attack

well to be truthful the blueprint's
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew

only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

but i got your mom deepthroatin'
i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothin' in common poodle
i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
it's me my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case 'cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come tryin'
to censor you like that one line
i said on i'm back from the mathers lp 1 when i
tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm
morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
you write normal fuck being normal
and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad
singin' to a man while he played piano
man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you
lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad
uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman
innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating
'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated
i make elevating music you make elevator music
oh he's too mainstream
well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock shock rap with doc
throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it
i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you
how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too
ugh school flunky pill junkie
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you
i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel
i'ma sleep in the front seat
bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky
but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
i have then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then
but if i can't batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake 'em a cake then
don't mistake him for satan
it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation
to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and

verse 1
y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced throwin' her over furniture agh
it's the return of the oh wait no way you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did did he
and dr dre said nothing you idiots

feminist women love eminem
chicka chicka chicka slim shady i'm sick of him
look at him walkin' around grabbin' his youknowwhat
flippin' the youknowwho yeah but he's so cute though
yeah i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
and if i'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they've got the discovery channel don't they
we ain't nothin' but mammalswell some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote

verse 3
i'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause i'm only givin' you
things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it i just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
it's funny 'cause at the rate i'm going when i'm thirty
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
he could be working at burger king spittin' on your onion rings
or in the parking lot circling screaming i don't give a fuck
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time loud as you can how does it go

plane crash
yeah illa illa illa
yo i'm just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me cause i feel like i wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
yeah
verse
let me explain just how to make greatness
straight out the gate i'm bout to break it down
ain't no mistakes allowed but make no mistake i'm 'bout
to rape the alphabet i may raise some brows
if i press the issue just to get the anger out brrr
full magazine could take staples out
savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
but bitch i'm off the chain like kala brown
motherfucker shut the fuck up when im talkin lil' bitch
im sorry wait what's your talent oh critiquin'
my talent oh bitch i don't know who the fuck yall are
to give a subpar bar or even have an opinion of you
you mention me millions of views attention in news
i mention you loselose for me winwin for you
billions of views your ten cents are two
skim through the music to give shit reviews
to get clicks but bitch you just lit the fuse
don't get misconstrued business as us'
shitlist renewed so get shit to do
or get dissed 'cause i just don't get
what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow
everyone copies though prob'ly no
get this fuckin' audio out my audi yo adis
i can see why people like lil yachty but not me though
not even dissin' it just ain't for me
all i am simply is just an emcee
maybe stan just isn't your cup of tea get it
maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
maybe i need to stir up shit preferably
shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill y'all want me to ill
i should eat a pill probably i will
old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror i don't see my breath
possibly i'm dead i must be possessed
like an evil spell i'm evil evil spelled
jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick
with an ice pick stick it in a vise grip
hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
like vice president mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip
these are things that i'd rather do than hear you on a mic
since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ man how many times is
someone gonna fuck on my bitch fuck my side chick
you won't ever see em icy
but as cold as i get on the mic
i polarize shit so the thames might freeze
and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it
bitch i got the club on smash like a nightstick yeah
turn down for what
i ain't loud enough nah turn the valium up illa illa illa
'cause i don't know how i'm gonna get your mouths to shut
now when it doesn't matter what caliber
i spit at i'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
you'll turn around and just be like man how the fuck
sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks
and now he wants to take it out on us ooouuu
but last week an exfan mailed me a copy
of the mathers lp to tell me to study
it'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me ooouuu
i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that
i'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
especially an effing recovery clone of me nfing
so fingerbang chicken wang mgk igg' azae'
lil pump lil xan imitate lil wayne
i should aim at everybody in the game pick a name
i'm fed up with bein' humble
and rumor is i'm hungry i'm sure you heard rumblings
i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
i heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbojumbo
the era that i'm from will pummel you that's what it's comin' to
what the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it
i'm gonna crumble you and i'll take a number two
and dump on you if you ain't joyner
if you ain't kendrick or cole or sean then you're a goner
i'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper
you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonald's
but if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get revival
but y'all are actin' like i tried to serve you up a slider
maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned
and you woulda bought it
but sayin' i no longer got it
'cause you missed a line and never caught it
'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it
'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
with your expertise and knowledge but you'll never be an artist
and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
what i'll never be is flawless all i'll ever be is honest illa illa illa
even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it
even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
with a bottle full of malt liquor
but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer
the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom
if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
i don't see why y'all even started with me
i get in beefs my enemies die
i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
i'm east side never be caught slippin'
now you see why i don't sleep not even a wink i don't blink
i don't doze off i don't even nod to the beats
i don't even close my fuckin' eyes when i sneeze
aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage
the thing ain't even orangeoh my god that's a reach
shout to all my colorblind people
each and everyone of y'all if you call a fire engine green
aquamarine or you think water is pink
dawg that's a date  looks like an olive to me
look there's an apple  no it's not it's a peach
so fingerbang pootie tang
burger king gucci gang dookie dang
charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesn't matter what i say
give me donkey of the day
what a way for 2018 to get underway
but i'm gonna say everything that i wanna say
welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah
invite 'em in like a one a day
i'm not done preach
'cause i feel like the beast of burden
that line in the sand was it even worth it
'cause the way i see people turning's
makin' it seem worthless it's startin' to defeat the purpose
i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
or still yet to be determined
'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped
but if i could go back i'd at least reword it
and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent
sold the dream to that he's deserted
but i think it's workin'
these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
and he's too scurred to answer me with words
'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
but i know at least he's heard it
'cause agent orange just sent the secret service
to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him
or ask if i'm linked to terrorists
i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists
but my beef is more media journalists
hold up hold up hold up
i said my beef is more meaty a journalist
can get a mouthful of flesh
and yes i mean eating a penis
'cause they've been pannin' my album to death
so i've been givin' the media fingers
don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
but they've been puttin' me through the ringer
so i ain't ironin' shit out with the press
but i just took this beat to the cleanersyou might also like734embed"

the scene begins in a dream sequence the animation is slightly fuzzy and the sky is a peculiar cream color we see aang shaking appa's reigns smiling cut to a wide shot of aang on appa the screen pans right to show sokka flying gracefully on aang's glider close up of sokka smiling at aang whom we see smiling at sokka in return aang looks over to his right to see katara flying on an enormous version of momo she waves at him cut to shot of all three flying towards the camera

katara we need you aang
aang i need you too

aang turns from katara to look straight ahead in alarm a huge black storm cloud has gathered ahead cut back to aang

aang be careful guys guys

he looks from side to side in surprise the shot widens to reveal that sokka and katara have disappeared cut to a shot from aang's pov he is approaching the storm quickly suddenly a crosslegged monk gyatso drops from the top of the frame to rest just above appa's head

aang gyatso
gyatso why did you disappear
aang i didn't mean to

cut to side view as aang leans forward to touch his old master but before he can gyatso turns grey as ash and begins to blow away starting from the head down soon he is gone after gyatso disintegrates the camera cuts to a wide side shot of aang and appa entering the storm clouds

gyatso from oc we need you aang

inside the cloud lightning illuminates the sky it is pouring rain and aang screams as he holds on to appa for his life appa and aang plunge into the sea in a replay of his accident a century ago aang relinquishes his hold on appa and begins to drift away in the water

many voices we need you aang we need you

at the end of the last sentence a vision of the fire lord wreathed in flame is visible for an instant in the afterglow of a lightning strike at this horrifying vision aang wakes instantly from his dream with a start it is night at their most recent camp he disturbs momo who wakes up katara and sokka while trying to get away sokka ready with his knife and boomerang
sokka groggily huh uh what's going on did we get captured again
aang it's nothing i just had a bad dream go back to sleep
sokka don't have to tell me twice

sokka rolls over back to sleep cut to aang in a fetal position looking pained

katara are you all right aang
aang i'm okay
katara you seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately you wanna tell me about it
aang i think i just need some rest
sokka sits up excited you guys want to hear about my dream silence as katara looks annoyed that's ok i didn't wanna talk about it anyway

sokka and katara lie back down to sleep fade to a day scene of a beach cut to appa yawning and katara packing for them to get under way aang sits atop appa and when the bison is done yawning aang points to the heavens

aang look at those clear skies buddy should be some smooth flying
katara examining empty food bag well we better smoothly fly ourselves to a market cause we're out of food
sokka alarmed guys wait this was in my dream we shouldn't go to the market
katara what happened in your dream

cut to sokka his eyes are bugged out in fright and camera zooms in on him and rotates slightly the background turns a sickly green and an eerie sound effect is heard

sokka food eats people

cut to katara and aang who are not impressed then back to sokka with momo on his right

sokka also momo could talk to momo you said some very unkind things
cut to an overhead shot of the ocean a flock of birds fly by as the screen pans left to reveal prince zuko's ship steaming towards the southeast corner of the screen cut to the main deck where iroh is sniffing the air in the foreground and zuko is looking out of a telescope in the background

iroh there is a storm coming a big one
zuko lowering the telescope you're out of your mind uncle the weather's perfect there is not a cloud in sight
iroh the storm is approaching from the north i suggest we alter our course and head southwest
zuko we know the avatar is traveling northward so we will do the same
iroh prince zuko consider the safety of the crew
zuko the safety of the crew doesn't matter

zuko's eyebrow goes up in concern as a crewmember enters from the left in the background cut to a close up of the lieutenant who has clearly overhead zuko's remark and is unhappy zuko realizing this begins to speak to the lieutenant and walk up until his face is right in front of the lieutenant's

zuko finding the avatar is far more important than any individual's safety

zuko enters the ship and shuts the hatch behind him iroh stands next to the lieutenant

iroh he doesn't mean that he's just all worked up

cut to a harbor scene where appa lies in the water next to one of the jetties as if he were a ship the scene is quickly followed by a shot of katara examining a fruit at a produce stand in the harbor the shopkeeper is clearly exasperated at katara's suspicion of the fruit's quality

shopkeeper ah it's good it's perfect i'm telling you

katara shakes the fruit which makes a swishing sound

katara i don't know if i like the sound of that swishing

the shopkeeper comes around the stand to face katara aang and sokka wait to the left of the produce stand sokka carries a basket of fruit
shopkeeper swishing means it's ripe it's the ripe juices swishing around eh
aang i think it's true katara swishing means it's ripe
katara putting fruit back i just realized we're out of money anyway
shopkeeper grabbing basket from sokka awww

the shopkeeper kicks sokka as he walks by cut to the dock where the three stand sokka rubbing the sport where he was kicked an old fisherman and his wife walk behind them in the background the camera slowlu panning left to keep them in the frame longer

sokka depressed out of food and out of money now what are we supposed to do
katara you could get a job smart guy

in the background the old woman grabs the old man by the shoulder they begin a conversation amongst themselves but overheard by aang katara and sokka

old woman we shouldn't go out there please the fish can wait there's going to be a terrible storm
old man ahh you're crazy it's a nice day no clouds no wind no nothing so quit you're naggin' woman

aang to katara and sokka maybe we should find some shelter
sokka are you kidding shelter from what

the old man and woman continue their argument

old woman my joints say there's going to be a storm a bad one
old man well it's your joints against my brain
old woman then i hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish cause i ain't comin
old man then i'll find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get how do you like that
sokka running up to them i'll go
old man pointing at sokka you're hired
sokka to his friends what you said get a job' and he's paying double
old man looking at sokka as if he were an alien double who told ya that nonsense

cut to zuko's ship on the ocean camera panning right to reveal the black edges of an ominous storm zuko's ship is making straight for it cut to zuko walking on deck four crewman including the lieutenant from before are there looking at the storm clouds the lieutenant turns folding his arms across his chest to address the prince

lieutenant jee uh looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all
iroh entering from left lucky guess
zuko crossing to the lieutenant lieutenant you'd better learn some respect pointing at his chest with two fingers or i will teach it to you

zuko walks past the lieutenant who can no longer contain his contempt for the prince as the lieutenant speaks iroh is visible in the background making decapitation motions with his hand trying to head off the conflict

lieutenant jee what do you know about respect the way you talk to everyone around here from your hard working crew to your esteemed uncle shows you know nothing about respect you don't care about anyone but yourself then again what should i expect from a spoiled prince

zuko stops in mid step shortly into the lieutenant's speech iroh sighs and puts his hand over his face resigning himself to the brewing disaster by the end of the tirade prince zuko's eyebrow is twitching he is clearly stung by the accusations he turns and assumes a firebending stance the lieutenant follows suit

iroh hands up in gesture of calming easy now

cut to zuko and the lieutenant's hands crossing at the wrists indicating that the ritual of combat has begun when they cross the sound of steel on steel is heard and smoke curls from where they meet iroh appears between them and breaks their wrists apart is neat movement

iroh enough we are all a bit tired from being at sea so long i'm sure after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better

the prince and the lieutenant glare at each other a moment longer then both turn and walk away in opposite directions

zuko to iroh i don't need your help keeping order on my ship

iroh places a hand on zuko's shoulder but zuko rudely shove him off zuko walks to the bow where it is clear the storm clouds now fill the sky cut back to harbor where appa still wallows in the water cut to aang in the foreground sokka loading a fishing boat in the background aang looks worriedly at the sky which is clearly full of black storm clouds the wind has picked up as well

aang sokka maybe this isn't such a good idea look at the sky
sokka i said i was gonna do this job i can't back out just because of some bad weather
old woman from oc then from wider shot of boat the boy with the tattoos has some sense you should listen to him

cut to close up of the old man as he puts down some boxes on the ship a question forms in his mind

old man boy with tattoos he turns to aang and looks at him airbender tattooswell i'll be a hogmonkey's uncle you're the avatar ain't ya

cut to aang with katara close behind him to his left

katara smiling hands on hips that's right
old man well don't be so smiley about it the avatar disappeared for a hundred years jabbing aang's chest with his forefinger you turned your back on the world
katara coming to aang's side angry don't yell at him aang would never turn his back on anyone
old man oh he wouldn't uh then i guess i must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering

as the old man makes this damning pronouncement cut to aang with the distorted camera effect of the world warping around him a visual testimonial to the sickening guilt welling up within the avatar cut to katara stepping in front of aang so that she is between him and the old man she is irate

katara aang is the bravest person i know he has done nothing but help people and save lives since i met him it's not his fault he disappeared right aang aang what's wrong

aang has been backing up while katara has been telling off the old man when she is finished he flees opening his glider and taking off towards the mountains

old man that's right keep flyin
katara you're a horrible old man
old man ehh
katara mounting appa appa yip yip

katara and appa take off drenching the old man sokka emerges from the hold just as the old man shakes off the excess water

sokka hey they left without saying goodbye
old man you're friends ain't too polite are they
sokka i know this one time i was
old man handing sokka a box yeh yeh yeh yeh get below deck

fade to commercial break



act ii

when the show returns the camera shows a longshot of appa skirting a mountain face at high speed the sky is now black with storm clouds and it is pouring rain cut to a closer shot of katara in appa's driver's seat' shielding her eyes as she searches for aang in the rain the shot swivels as katara and appa pass showing a cave in the rock face with an exposed parapet and a stone staircase leading up to it from the shoreline below cut to a shot from the inside of the cave looking out where the storm is intensifying katara enters wiping the water off her sleeves she stands still seeing something in front of her the shot widens to show aang in the foreground farther back in the cave he is sitting with his hands in his lap looking downcast he will not turn to look at katara

aang i'm sorry for running away
katara it's ok that fisherman was way out of line
aang actually he wasn't
katara what do you mean
aang i don't wanna talk about it
katara it has to do with your dream doesn't it

katara walks over to aang kneels by him and puts a hand on his shoulder

katara talk to me
aang well it's kind of a long story

suddenly momo runs back chittering and the sound of a huge animal is heard from behind aang towards the cave entrance appa's nose and bangs appear from the right nudging aang cut to a full shot towards the cave entrance which is now completely plugged with a sopping appa

katara i'm gonna try to get a little fire going

aang strokes appa's chin then cut to katara stoking a little cheery fire on the right aang on the left with momo in his lap when aang begins to speak the camera pans up and enters a dreamy flashback sequence

aang i'll never forget the day the monks told me i was the avatar

the pan up changes quickly from the rock of the cave to an outdoor shot of the southern air temple in its heyday a stone plaza is populated with many young airbenders playing games a flying bison soars in the distance

aang i was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall i was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter

cut to a shot of aang addressing a group of young airbenders most seem aang's age or younger one is taller and probably older aang demonstrates the air scooter move

aang first you form a ball then you gotta get on quick

aang makes an air ball and sits on it fast he laughs and begins to move at terrific speed across the plaza he goes upside down in a nearby archway under a walking bridge then climbs a wall and gets up on to the bridge coming back to the plaza by a nearby set of stairs aang exclaims yeh and woohoo as he travels cut to the older boy who readies his own attempt

older boy okay here goes he makes a ball
aang quick get on
older boy wh wh whoaaaa he wobbles and is thrown ugh
aang dismounting his own scooter you kinda have to balance on it like it's a top he twirls his finger to demonstrate
older boy man that's hard

a young boy enters the screen from the left and tugs at aang's shoulder

young boy where'd ya learn that trick aang
aang i made it up
young boy doing a goofy dance wow

screen pans left to show five elderly airbender monks on the stones steps leading up to the bridge monk gyatso is one of them

monk gyatso aang come with us we need to speak with you

cut to aang who obeys with a look of trepidation on his face the other kids looking at him strangely cut to a chamber in the air temple where the five elder monks sit crosslegged and serene on five evenly spaced stools the middle monk's stool rests under an ornate parasol he is likely the leader or abbot of the monastery monk gyatso is the second from the left aang kneels in front of them head down his back to the camera he lifts his head to address them

aang how do you know it's me
elder monk 4 we have known you were the avatar for some time do you remember these

the fourth monk on the right who has just spoken reveals a rolled up package which he airbends over to aang it lands at his feet and rolls open of its own accord inside are four children's toys on the left is a little toy turtle second from the left is a propeller toy third from the left is a little monkey or donkey the fourth is rattle type object with yellow and red swirls on its face

aang those were some of my favorite toys when i was little he picks up the propeller toy
elder monk 4 you chose them from among thousands of toys aang the toys you picked were the four avatar relics these items belonged to avatars past your own past lives
aang i just chose them because they seemed fun

he smiles and pulls the cord on the propeller toy sending the propeller spinning into the air it spins through the air and the scene cuts back to a close view of the five monks

elder monk 4 you chose them because they were familiar
monk gyatso normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned 16 but there are troubling signs storm clouds are gathering
abbot i fear that war may be upon us young avatar
monk gyatso we need you aang

aang lowers his head his responsibility crushing him his head stays lowered but the flashback ends his head remains lowered in the present as well cut to a wider shot of aang on the left katara on the right the fire between them katara looks on him with concern and sympathy cut to zuko's ship navigating the storm then cut to the lieutenant from the earlier confrontation lowering a cup he has taken a drink from he is inside the ship somewhere his face bathed in firelight

lieutenant jee i'm sick of taking his orders and i'm tired of chasing his avatar

cut to the lieutenant sitting at a table and addressing a crewman on his left making wide hand gestures to drive home his point

lieutenant jee i mean who does zuko think he is
iroh from oc do you really want to know

cut to a view of the crewmen sitting around a fire barrel from a point at the top of the stairs from the upper deck the lieutenant and the three other crewman at the fire barrel stand in respect

lieutenant jee general iroh we were just 
iroh entering from left with a hand raised in acceptance it's ok may i join you
lieutenant jee of course sir

iroh approaches and sits down with the men he strokes his beard and begins to speak

iroh try to understand my nephew is a complicated young man he has been through much

fade to a flashback of a younger zuko without his trademark scar his look of determination however has not changed he walks down a hall to a pair of fire nation guards who block his attempt to enter the room beyond

zuko in a higher voice than we are used to let me in iroh appears from the left putting his hands on the young man's shoulders
iroh prince zuko what's wrong
zuko i want to go into the war chamber but the guard won't let me pass

zuko's voice breaks slightly at the end he is clearly disappointed iroh leads him a short distance away from the guards

iroh you're not missing anything trust me these meetings are dreadfully boring
zuko if i'm gonna rule this nation one day don't you think i need to start learning as much as i can
iroh very well but you must promise not to speak these old folks are a bit sensitive you know
zuko bowing to iroh thank you uncle

iroh puts him around zuko's shoulders and walks him past the guards who make no move to stop them cut to a wide shot of the war chamber it is a temple like chamber with a throne on a dais wreathed in fire the back wall is occupied by some sort of huge ornately carved red statue the screen pans down to the show the war council in session fire nation generals sit around a map of the earth kingdom continent that adorns the floor one of the generals on the left is standing to address the general staff

general the earth kingdom defenses are concentrated here

cut to a view from the throne where the fire lord is watching the generals discuss the situation the cut back to the speaker

general a dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors so i am recommending the 41st division
old general but the 41st is entirely new recruits how do you expect them to defeat a powerful earth kingdom battalion
general coldly i don't they'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear what better to use as bait then fresh meat
zuko jumping up you can't sacrifice an entire division like that those soldiers love and defend our nation how can you betray them

cut to a view down the map as the generals look back to zuko clearly disapproving of zuko's outburst the scene fades to the present where iroh continue his story to the crewmen

iroh zuko was right you see but it was not his place to speak out and there were dire consequences

cut to overhead shot of iroh and the crewmen around the table iroh lowers his head in sadness at the memory the scenes fades replaced by an overhead shot of aang appa and katara around the fire

katara so you were upset that you were the avatar why wouldn't you be excited about it
aang well i didn't know how to feel about it all i knew is that after i found out everything began changing

fade to another flashback at the plaza near the south wall of the southern air temple this time the plaza is full of young airbenders riding on air scooters laughing and having fun

aang hey not bad you guys have been practicing
young boy scooting around aang not only that we made up a game you can play with the air scooters
aang great

aang makes his own air scooter but the young boy looks confused and a bit alarmed he stops his scooter the shot widens to show the other young airbenders stopping their scooters as well

aang dismayed what's going on
older boy unhappy but without malice now that you're the avatar it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on
aang trying to smile but i'm still the same  nothing's changed so what i can't play
older boy that's the only fair way
aang dismounting his scooter oh ok
young boy sorry aang

the young airbenders look upon as he retreats from them sadness in their eyes the older boy turns to address them

older boy okay now who wants to have jinju on their team

screen pans right to reveal a dirty looking airbender boy with a stupid grin on his face who makes an equally stupid noise cut to a view of aang and gyatso playing pai sho through an exterior window then a close up of aang who absentmidndely moves a token on the board he is sad and distracted

monk gyatso very interesting move young one
aang what do you mean

behind his back monk gyatso begins to bend air in an arch over his head and behind aang the wind blows aang's hood up over his face giving the old monk time to switch a few pieces before aang can remove the hood

aang pointing at the board hey

both begin to laugh the door opens to reveal one of the other monk elders in fact the one who had been sitting fourth from the right in the prior scene

elder monk 4 you're playing games with him the avatar should be training
monk gyatso aang has already trained enough for today
elder monk 4 time is short come with me i must test you on some high level techniques

aang gets up and begins to follow the elder out of the room monk gyatso then raises his hand in a gesture of cessation

monk gyatso no as long as i am his guardian i will decide when he trains and when he gets his butt kicked at pai sho
elder monk 4 close up clearly angry huh

the elder monk stalks off as aang turns to smile at monk gyatso the flashback ends as an overhead shot of the cave scene returns this scene then fades to be replaced by iroh's face

iroh after zuko's outburst in the meeting the fire lord became very angry with him he said that prince zuko's challenge of the general was an act of complete disrespect and there was only one way to resolve this
lieutenant jee horrified agni kai a fire duel
iroh that's right zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid but zuko misunderstood when he turned to face his opponent he was surprised to see it was not the general zuko had spoken out against a general's plan but by doing so in the fire lord's war room it was the fire lord whom he had disrespected zuko would have to duel his own father

in the midst of iroh's story we see zuko in a rectangular arena with a large crowd on either side he drops his ceremonial cloak to the floor exposing his bare chest he turns to face his opponent and recognizing him freezes in horror the scene then cuts to the cave with aang and katara

aang then just when i was starting to feel better something worse happened

aang's flashback resumes this time of monk gyatso and elder monk 4 standing in front of the monk who sits on the middle stool under the parasol presumably the abbot

monk gyatso aang needs to have freedom and fun he needs to grow up as a normal boy
elder monk 4 humph you cannot keep protecting him from his destiny
abbot gyatso i know you mean well but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment
monk gyatso all i want is what is best for him
abbot but what we need is what's best for the world looking down for a moment before raising his head to continue you and aang must be separated the avatar will be sent away to the eastern air temple to complete his training

monk gyatso bows as the camera zooms past him to reveal aang eavesdropping through a hole in the ceiling his eyes alarmed and distraught cut to commercial break



act iii

show returns to a shot from inside the cave looking out it is still pouring the camera pans left back to appa katara and aang around the fire

katara that's awful aang i don't know what to say

katara tries to put her hand on his shoulder but he gets up angry

aang how could they do that to me they wanted to take away everything i knew and everyone i loved

aang's avatar spirit begins to activate the arrow tattoos on his body beginning to glow and the energy shell seen in the southern air temple beginning to form around him he shuts it down however as katara cries out as cinders from the fire swirl around her

katara whoa hot cinders
aang his glow fading i'm sorry i got so mad
katara you have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that
aang well that's not exactly what happened

aang's looks downcast and guilty as the camera zooms past his left shoulder the flashback then continues showing an overhead shot of the young airbender monks hard at play on their air scooters back at the south wall the shot zooms backwards to reveal that we are seeing the kids from aang's pov  he is watching them from a window high up in the temple he is sad and clearly longs to be normal again while aang narrates to katara the aang in the flashback leaves his window and flops dejectedly on his bed

aang from oc narrating from the present i was afraid and confused i didn't know what to do

the scene fades to a night scene in the hallway outside of aang's bedroom monk gyatso approaches knocks and enters

monk gyatso aang i'm not going to let them take you away from me aang

gyatso sees a rolled up scroll on aang's bed he picks it up and opens it his eyes going wide in concern he draws an intake of breath to look at the window where it is storming violently the camera pans across the storm tossed ocean as aang narrates again from the present

aang i never saw gyatso again

the flashback continues with aang's and appa's plunge into the sea during the storm activation of aang's avatar spirit and subsequent encasement in ice

aang next thing i knew i was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg

the flashback ends aang looks vacantly across the fire a slightly guilty expression still settled on his face

katara you ran away
aang looking up at katara and then the fire nation attacked our temple my people needed me and i wasn't there to help
katara you don't know what would've 
aang the world needed me and i wasn't there to help
katara aang
aang the fisherman was right i did turn my back on the world
katara you're being too hard on yourself even if you did run away i think it was meant to be if you had stayed you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders
aang you don't know that
katara i know it's meant to be this way the world needs you now you give people hope

aang slowly smiles raising his head to look at her an expression of hope spreading across his face momo hops over to aang and chitters fade back to the fire lit chamber on zuko's ship where iroh continues his story

iroh when prince zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him he begged for mercy

while iroh speaks the scene cuts to view of iroh's face through the fire that burns in the fire barrel around which the crewman sit when his voice trails off the flashback continues where we left off with an overhead shot of zuko in the rectangular arena a much larger opponent silhouetted advances slowly on zuko cut to a side view of the horrified zuko

zuko please father i only had the fire nation's best interest at heart i'm sorry i spoke out of turn

cut to a closer shot of the advancing fire lord still silhouetted against the fires burning around the arena he too is shirtless but built massively

fire lord ozai you will fight for your honor
zuko stricken abasing himself on the floor i meant you no disrespect i am your loyal son
fire lord ozai rise and fight prince zuko
zuko i won't fight you
fire lord ozai you will learn respect and suffering will be your teacher

the fire lord now stands a few feet from zuko as the prince raises his tear filled face to his father cut to a close up of some spectators they are familiar many in the background are generals from the war council the three in the foreground are from left a grinning admiral zhao then either captain or commander general iroh looking fearful for his nephew and a cruel looking young girl in a soldier's uniform who is clearly hoping for the worst to befall prince zuko this is azula zuko's sister as the audience learns at the end of the season finale for book one she raises her left fist in anticipation of the disgrace her brother is undergoing iroh's looks away in despair

iroh i looked away

the spectators are illuminated by flame zuko's scream of anguish is heard in the background and the camera zooms to a close up of iroh the flashback ends but iroh's face in the present is in the same pose as it was when zuko was scarred it is clearly an unpleasant memory

lieutenant jee abashed i always thought that prince zuko was in a training accident
iroh it was no accident after the duel the fire lord said that by refusing to fight zuko had shown shameful weakness as punishment he was banished and sent to capture the avatar only then could he return with his honor
lieutenant jee so that's why he's so obsessed capturing the avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal
iroh things will never return to normal but the important thing is the avatar gives zuko hope

cut to a shot of zuko's back he is in darkness except the flame on the altar in front of him the flame is blocked by his body so he is silhouetted a flashback appears in a still frame it of two young children running across the crest of a hillside an older man their father follows behind the colors are drab but the children look happy the scene cuts quickly back to zuko in front of the altar and then to another flashback this one is a close of a young boy zuko perhaps at aang's age standing on that same hillcrest with his father next to him his father's hand is on his shoulder cut back to zuko at the altar again and then back to the previous flashback except this time from the front showing a much younger zuko clearly smiling and happy the music becomes serious though as the flashback fades around the boy's face replaced by the face of zuko from the present scarred and unhappy zuko turns as a lightning strike is hears cut to a shot of the ship in the storm lightening striking the bridge cut to the cave where aang and katar turn to look at someone entering the cave the storm still raging outside

old woman help oh please help
katara rushing to her side it's ok you're safe

both walk back to the fire deeper in the cave

old woman but my husband isn't
katara what do you mean where's sokka
old woman they haven't returned they should've been back by now and this storm is becoming a typhoon they're caught out at sea
aang standing resolute i'm going to find them
katara i'm going with you
old woman i'm staying here

cut to exterior shot of cave where the weather is horrible appa's nose is sticking out of the cave he is ready to take off cut to aang and katara getting on to appa aang turns to the old woman

aang to the old woman we'll be back soon i promise

cut to appa flying away from the cave and then a quick cut to zuko's ship battling the waves cut again to zuko and the lieutenant struggling to stay upright on the ship's main deck water drenches them and the deck repeatedly

zuko where were we hit
lieutenant jee i don't know
iroh look

iroh points up to the bridge tower a crewman hangs off some of the rigging

zuko the helmsman

cut to zuko climbing the external ladder up to the bridge area the lieutenant behind him cut to the deck where iroh senses something a lighting strike flares but iroh bends the lightning through his body away from the men trying to rescue the helmsman and forces it to strike open water cut back to iroh smoking and looking confused but otherwise undamaged cut back to the helmsman who finally lets go with a cry he falls for a moment but a hand grabs him zuko and the lieutenant have worked together to save him cut to katara and aang flying on appa in the storm

katara where are they
aang come on appa

aang sees a massive wall of water up ahead it towers above them appa can't pull up in time but they bust through its crest with a combination of appa's strength and aang using his staff like a helicopter blade to part the water in the distance they see a small boat silhouetted by lighting strikes

aang pointing to the horizon the boat it's there

cut to a longshot of appa flying in the clouds then a quick cut to zuko iroh and the lieutenant who can clearly see appa in turn

zuko the avatar
lieutenant jee what do you want to do sir
zuko pausing to consider let him go we need to get this ship to safety
iroh then we must head directly into the eye of the storm

iroh smiles slightly as the screen pans left to show zuko and the crew looking out over the bow then cut to sokka and the old man struggling to pilot the fishing boat

sokka i'm too young to die
old man i'm not but i still don't wanna

cut to a longshot of the fishing boat struggling against the waves appa flies in close and aang jumps onto the boat lighting strikes the main mast which breaks off it is about to hit aang but he splits it in two the halves falling harmlessly on either side of him sokka has a rope in his hands which aang grabs

aang hang on to the rope

aang airbends himself back onto appa pulling sokka and the old man with him both land on appa as well the old man spitting out some water and smile sheepishly behind them a shadow appears and the sound of rushing water is heard the view widens to show a wave building behind them much larger than even the one shown before appa tries to escape but the wave is too fast they are submerged in a sequence that is eerily similar to the scene where he freezed himself aang drifts away from appa and his friends in the water his avatar spirit activates but in a departure from the previous encounter instead of creating an iceberg he surrounds himself and his friends with a ball of energy and raises them back up out of the water and into the sky cut to zuko and the crew on the deck of the ship they have reached the eye of the storm which they can see above them the wind has died down and it is drizzling

zuko uncle i am sorry
iroh smiling putting a hand on his nephew's shoulder your apology is accepted

the avatar's bubble of energy erupts from the sea in boiling blue mass in front of the prow of zuko's ship and rockets into the air cut to aang looking back at the ship and cut to zuko looking up from the deck and the camera angle widens indicating that we are seeing the receding zuko from aang's viewpoint cut the reverse as appa recedes up into the eye cut to appa now standing out in the drizzle on the parapet outside the cave where aang had told katara his story cut to aang and the old man at the cave entrance the old woman running to embrace her husband

old woman oh you're alive voice turning sour and pointing to aang you owe this boy an apology
aang he doesn't have to apologize
old man mmm uh what if instead of an apology i give him a free fish and we call it even
aang actually i don't eat meat
old man fish ain't meat
sokka holding out his hand seriously you're still gonna pay me right

the old man drops a fish into his outstretched hand with a wet smacking sound sokka makes a frightened sound cut to aang and katara

aang katara i think you were right before i'm done dwelling on the past
katara really
aang i can't make guesses about how things would have turned out if i hadn't run away i'm here now and i'm going to make the most of it
katara smiling i don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore
old man entering from left and putting his hand on aang's shoulder uh if you weren't here now well i guess i wouldn't be either thank you for saving my life avatar

cut to sokka looking out of the cave entrance

sokka do you hear that it's stopped raining

cut to longshot of outside where the sun is starting to break through the shot widens to show the parapet where appa and the rest are now standing appa shakes himself off drenching everyone

everyone appa

as the telling signs of age rain down
a single tear is droppin'
through the valleys of an aging face
that this world has forgotten

verse 2
there is no reconciliation
that will put me in my place
and there is no time like the present
to drink these draining seconds
but seldom do these words ring true
when i'm constantly failing you
walls that we just can't break through
until we disappear

prechorus
so tell me now if this ain't love
then how do we get out cause i don't know

chorus
that's when she said i don't hate you boy i just want to save you
while there's still something left to save whoaohoh whoaohoh
that's when i told her i love you girl but i'm not the answer
for the questions that you still have

starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square west then at reduced pace each bearing left gardiner's place by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of temple street north then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt bearing right temple street north as far as hardwicke place approaching disparate at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before george's church diametrically the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends

of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary

music literature ireland dublin paris friendship woman prostitution diet the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets the roman catholic church ecclesiastical celibacy the irish nation jesuit education careers the study of medicine the past day the maleficent influence of the presabbath stephen's collapse

did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience

both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious national social and ethical doctrines both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism

were their views on some points divergent

stephen dissented openly from bloom's view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while bloom dissented tacitly from stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature bloom assented covertly to stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus son of potitus son of odyssus sent by pope celestine i in the year 432 in the reign of leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart 266 ad suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin at first no bigger than a woman's hand

was there one point on which their views were equal and negative

the influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees

had bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past

in 1884 with ower goldberg and cecil turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between longwood avenue and leonard's corner and leonard's corner and synge street and synge street and bloomfield avenue in 1885 with percy apjohn in the evenings reclined against the wall between gibraltar villa and bloomfield house in crumlin barony of uppercross in 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps in front parlours in third class railway carriages of suburban lines in 1888 frequently with major brian tweedy and his daughter miss marion tweedy together and separately on the lounge in matthew dillon's house in roundtown once in 1892 and once in 1893 with julius mastiansky on both occasions in the parlour of his bloom's house in lombard street west

what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884 1885 1886 1888 1892 1893 1904 did bloom make before their arrival at their destination
he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations

as in what ways

from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received existence with existence he was with any as any with any from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived

what action did bloom make on their arrival at their destination

at the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers number 7 eccles street he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey

was it there

it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding

why was he doubly irritated

because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget

what were then the alternatives before the premeditatedly respectively and inadvertently keyless couple

to enter or not to enter to knock or not to knock

bloom's decision

a stratagem resting his feet on the dwarf wall he climbed over the area railings compressed his hat on his head grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall
did he fall

by his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of francis fraedman pharmaceutical chemist of 19 frederick street north on the last feast of the ascension to wit the twelfth day of may of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo golden number  epact 13 solar cycle 9 dominical letters c b roman indication 2 julian period 6617 mxmiv

did he rise uninjured by concussion

regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery ignited a lucifer match by friction set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock lit a high flame which by regulating he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle

what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive

reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 c p a man lighting a candle a man removing in turn each of his two boots a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of icp

did the man reappear elsewhere

alter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat with his candle

did stephen obey his sign

yes entering softly he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of bloom's house

what did bloom do

he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone one for stephen with its back to the area window the other for himself when necessary knelt on one knee composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of messrs flower and m'donald of 14 d'olier street kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air

of what similar apparitions did stephen think
of others elsewhere in other times who kneeling on one knee or on two had kindled fires for him of brother michael in the infirmary of the college of the society of jesus at clongowes wood sallins in the county of kildare of his father simon dedalus in an unfurnished room of his first residence in dublin number thirteen fitzgibbon street of his godmother miss kate morkan in the house of her dying sister miss julia morkan at 15 usher's island of his mother mary wife of simon dedalus in the kitchen of number twelve north richmond street on the morning of the feast of saint francisxavier 1898 of the dean of studies father butt in the physics' theatre of university college 16 stephen's green north of his sister dilly delia in his father's house in cabra

what did stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall

under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction

what did bloom see on the range

on the right smaller hob a blue enamelled saucepan on the left larger hob a black iron kettle

what did bloom do at the range

he removed the saucepan to the left hob rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow

did it flow

yes from roundwood reservoir in county wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of 5 per linear yard by way of the dargle rathdown glen of the downs and callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at stillorgan a distance of 22 statute miles and thence through a system of relieving tanks by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at eustace bridge upper leeson street though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 12 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer mr spencer harty ce on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the grand and royal canals as in 1893 particularly as the south dublin guardians notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter had been convicted of a wastage of 20000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation mr ignatius rice solicitor thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public selfsupporting taxpayers solvent sound

what in water did bloom waterlover drawer of water watercarrier returning to the range admire

its universality its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level its vastness in the ocean of mercator's projection its umplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard the independence of its units the variability of states of sea its hydrostatic quiescence in calm its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides its subsidence after devastation its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps arctic and antarctic its climatic and commercial significance its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn the multisecular stability of its primeval basin its luteofulvous bed its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories its alluvial deposits its weight and volume and density its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents gulfstream north and south equatorial courses its violence in seaquakes waterspouts artesian wells eruptions torrents eddies freshets spates groundswells watersheds waterpartings geysers cataracts whirlpools maelstroms inundations deluges cloudbursts its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve its secrecy in springs and latent humidity revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at ashtown gate saturation of air distillation of dew the simplicity of its composition two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen its healing virtues its buoyancy in the waters of the dead sea its persevering penetrativeness in runnels gullies inadequate dams leaks on shipboard its properties for cleansing quenching thirst and fire nourishing vegetation its infallibility as paradigm and paragon its metamorphoses as vapour mist cloud rain sleet snow hail its strength in rigid hydrants its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea its solidity in glaciers icebergs icefloes its docility in working hydraulic millwheels turbines dynamos electric power stations bleachworks tanneries scutchmills its utility in canals rivers if navigable floating and graving docks its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic photophobe numerically if not literally the inhabitants of the globe its ubiquity as constituting 90 of the human body the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes pestilential fens faded flowerwater stagnant pools in the waning moon

having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals why did he return to the stillflowing tap

to wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of barrington's lemonflavoured soap to which paper still adhered bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them face and hands in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller

what reason did stephen give for declining bloom's offer

that he was hydrophobe hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water his last bath having taken place in the month of october of the preceding year disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal distrusting aquacities of thought and language

what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape stomach and thenar or sole of foot

the incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius

what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress

dietary concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon salt ling and butter the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed

which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest

confidence in himself an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation

what concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire

the phenomenon of ebullition fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun primal source of heat radiant transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether heat convected a mode of motion developed by such combustion was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron in part reflected in part absorbed in part transmitted gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise i pound of water from 50 to 212 fahrenheit

what announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature

a double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously

for what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled

to shave himself

what advantages attended shaving by night

a softer beard a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours quiet reflections upon the course of the day a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises premonitions and perturbations a clattered milkcan a postman's double knock a paper read reread while lathering relathering the same spot a shock a shoot with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done

why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises

because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand

what quality did it his hand possess but with what counteracting influence

the operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means preferring in their natural order heliotherapy psychophysicotherapeutics osteopathic surgery

what lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by bloom

on the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups a moustachecup uninverted and saucer of crown derby four white goldrimmed eggcups and open shammy purse displaying coins mostly copper and a phial of aromatic violet comfits on the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper a drum of table salt four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper an empty pot of plumtree's potted meat an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one jersey pear a halfempty bottle of william gilbey and co's white invalid port half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper a packet of epps's soluble cocoa five ounces of anne lynch's choice tea at 2 per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar two onions one the larger spanish entire the other smaller irish bisected with augmented surface and more redolent a jar of irish model dairy's cream a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk converted by heat into water acidulous serum and semisolidified curds which added to the quantity subtracted for mr bloom's and mrs fleming's breakfasts made one imperial pint the total quantity originally delivered two cloves a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak on the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences

what attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser

four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets numbered 887 886

what reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow

reminiscences of coincidences truth stranger than fiction preindicative of the result of the gold cup flat handicap the official and definitive result of which he had read in the evening telegraph late pink edition in the cabman's shelter at butt bridge

where had previous intimations of the result effected or projected been received by him

in bernard kiernan's licensed premises 8 9 and 10 little britain street in david byrne's licensed premises 14 duke street in o'connell street lower outside graham lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway subsequently thrown away advertising elijah restorer of the church in zion in lincoln place outside the premises of f w sweny and co limited dispensing chemists when when frederick m bantam lyons had rapidly and successively requested perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the freeman's journal and national press which he had been about to throw away subsequently thrown away he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the turkish and warm baths 11 leinster street with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race graven in the language of prediction

what qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations

the difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation

his mood

he had not risked he did not expect he had not been disappointed he was satisfied

what satisfied him

to have sustained no positive loss to have brought a positive gain to others light to the gentiles

how did bloom prepare a collation for a gentile

he poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls four in all of epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed

what supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest

relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation crown derby presented to him by his only daughter millicent milly he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and in reduced measure to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife marion molly

was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality

his attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence epps's massproduct the creature cocoa

were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun

the reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 12 inches in the right side of his guest's jacket a gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition

who drank more quickly

bloom having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted three sips to his opponent's one six to two nine to three

what cerebration accompanied his frequentative act

concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of william shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life

had he found their solution

in spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages aided by a glossary he had derived imperfect conviction from the text the answers not bearing on all points

what lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him potential poet at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10 5 and 26 respectively by the shamrock a weekly newspaper

an ambition to squint
at my verses in print
makes me hope that for these you'll find room
if you so condescend
then please place at the end
the name of yours truly l bloom

did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him

name age race creed

what anagrams had he made on his name in youth

leopold bloom

ellpodbomool

molldopeloob

bollo edoom

old ollebo m p

what acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he kinetic poet sent to miss marion tweedy on the 14 february 1888

poets oft have sung in rhyme
of music sweet their praise divine
let them hymn it nine times nine
dearer far than song or wine
you are mine the world is mine

what had prevented him from completing a topical song music by r g johnston on the events of the past or fixtures for the actual years entitled if brian boru could but come back and see old dublin now commissioned by michael gunn lessee of the gaiety theatre 46 47 48 49 south king street and to be introduced into the sixth scene the valley of diamonds of the second edition 30 january 1893 of the grand annual christmas pantomime sinbad the sailor written by greenleaf whittier scenery by george a jackson and cecil hicks costumes by mrs and miss whelan produced by r shelton 26 december 1892 under the personal supervision of mrs michael gunn ballets by jessie noir harlequinade by thomas otto and sung by nelly bouverist principal girl

firstly oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest the anticipated diamond jubilee of queen victoria born 1820 acceded 1837 and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market secondly apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of york real and of his majesty king brian boru imaginary thirdly a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the grand lyric hall on burgh quay and the theatre royal in hawkins street fourthly distraction resultant from compassion for nelly bouverist's nonintellectual nonpolitical nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by nelly bouverist's revelations of white articles of nonintellectual nonpolitical nontopical underclothing while she nelly bouverist was in the articles fifthly the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from everybody's book of jokes 1000 pages and a laugh in every one sixthly the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous associated with the names of the new lord mayor daniel tallon the new high sheriff thomas pile and the new solicitorgeneral dunbar plunket barton

what relation existed between their ages

16 years before in 1888 when bloom was of stephen's present age stephen was 616 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of bloom's present age bloom would be 54 in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 12 to 13 12 the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable conceiving that to be possible till then 1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen would be 38 as bloom then was bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714 would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age that of methusalah 969 years while if stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 ad bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83300 years having been obliged to have been born in the year 81396 bc

what events might nullify these calculations

the cessation of existence of both or either the inauguration of a new era or calendar the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species inevitable but impredictable

how many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance

two the first in the lilacgarden of matthew dillon's house medina villa kimmage road roundtown in 1887 in the company of stephen's mother stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation the second in the coffeeroom of breslin's hotel on a rainy sunday in the january of 1892 in the company of stephen's father and stephen's granduncle stephen being then 5 years older

did bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father

very gratefully with grateful appreciation with sincere appreciative gratitude in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret he declined

did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them

mrs riordan a widow of independent means had resided in the house of stephen's parents from 1 september 1888 to 29 december 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892 1893 and 1894 in the city arms hotel owned by elizabeth o'dowd of 54 prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of bloom who resided also in the same hotel being at that time a clerk in the employment of joseph cuffe of 5 smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular road

had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her

he had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings an infirm widow of independent if limited means in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north circular road opposite mr gavin low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres hackney carriages tandems private and hired landaus dogcarts ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the phoenix park and vice versa

why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity

because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without pedestrians quadrupeds velocipedes vehicles passing slowly quickly evenly round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe

what distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased

the older her bezique cards and counters her skye terrier her suppositions wealth her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness the younger her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the immaculate conception her green and maroon brushes for charles stewart parnell and for michael davitt her tissue papers

were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable

the indoor exercises formerly intermittently practised subsequently abandoned prescribed in eugen sandow's physical strength and how to obtain it which designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility

had any special agility been his in earlier youth

though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a high school scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles

did either openly allude to their racial difference

neither

what reduced to their simplest reciprocal form were bloom's thoughts about stephen's thoughts about bloom and bloom's thoughts about stephen's thoughts about bloom's thoughts about stephen

he thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not

what the enclosures of reticence removed were their respective parentages

bloom only born male transubstantial heir of rudolf virag subsequently rudolf bloom of szombathely vienna budapest milan london and dublin and of ellen higgins second daughter of julius higgins born karoly and fanny higgins born hegarty stephen eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of simon dedalus of cork and dublin and of mary daughter of richard and christina goulding born grier

had bloom and stephen been baptised and where and by whom cleric or layman

bloom three times by the reverend mr gilmer johnston m a alone in the protestant church of saint nicolas without coombe by james o'connor philip gilligan and james fitzpatrick together under a pump in the village of swords and by the reverend charles malone c c in the church of the three patrons rathgar stephen once by the reverend charles malone c c alone in the church of the three patrons rathgar

did they find their educational careers similar

substituting stephen for bloom stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school substituting bloom for stephen blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory junior middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation first arts second arts and arts degree course of the royal university

why did bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life

because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to stephen or by stephen to him

what two temperaments did they individually represent

the scientific the artistic

what proofs did bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied rather than towards pure science

certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example the aeronautic parachute the reflecting telescope the spiral corkscrew the safety pin the mineral water siphon the canal lock with winch and sluice the suction pump

were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten

yes rendering obsolete popguns elastic airbladders games of hazard catapults they comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from aries to pisces miniature mechanical orreries arithmetical gelatine lozenges geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits globemap playingballs historically costumed dolls

what also stimulated him in his cogitations

the financial success achieved by ephraim marks and charles a james the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 george's street south the latter at his 6 12d shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 henry street admission 2d children 1d and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols vertically of maximum visibility divined horizontally of maximum legibility deciphered and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention to interest to convince to decide

which example did he adduce to induce stephen to deduce that originality though producing its own reward does not invariably conduce to success

his own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart drawn by a beast of burden in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing

what suggested scene was then constructed by stephen

solitary hotel in mountain pass autumn twilight fire lit in dark corner young man seated young woman enters restless solitary she sits she goes to window she stands she sits twilight she thinks on solitary hotel paper she writes she thinks she writes she sighs wheels and hoofs she hurries out he comes from his dark corner he seizes solitary paper he holds it towards fire twilight he reads solitary

what

in sloping upright and backhands queen's hotel queen's hotel queen's ho

what suggested scene was then reconstructed by bloom

the queen's hotel ennis county glare where rudolph bloom rudolf virag died on the evening of the 27 june 1886 at some hour unstated in consequence of an overdose of monkshood aconite selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment purchased by him at 1020 am on the morning of 27 june 1886 at the medical hall of francis dennehy 17 church street ennis after having though not in consequence of having purchased at 315 pm on the afternoon of 27 june 1886 a new boater straw hat extra smart after having though not in consequence of having purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid the toxin aforesaid at the general drapery store of james cullen 4 main street ennis

did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition

coincidence

did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see

he preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved

did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him described by the narrator as a pisgah sight of palestine or the parable of the plums

it with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms eg my favourite hero or procrastination is the thief of time composed during schoolyears seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial social personal and sexual success whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes of cent per cent merit for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form following the precedent of philip beaufoy or doctor dick or heblon's studies in blue to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following videlict tuesday 21 june s aloysius gonzaga sunrise 333 am sunset 829 pm

which domestic problem as much as if not more than any other frequently engaged his mind

what to do with our wives

what had been his hypothetical singular solutions

parlour games dominos halma tiddledywinks spillikins cup and ball nap spoil five bezique twentyfive beggar my neighbour draughts chess or backgammon embroidery darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society musical duets mandoline and guitar piano and flute guitar and piano legal scrivenery or envelope addressing biweekly visits to variety entertainments commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels state inspected and medically controlled social visits at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable

what instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned ninth solution

in disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were greek and irish and hebrew characters she had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in canada quebec she understood little of political complications internal or balance of power external in calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid after completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas green vitriol and nutgall unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both metempsychosis met him pike hoses alias a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture

what compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons places and things

the false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances proved true by construction the counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person proved true by experiment

how had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance

variously by leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page by assuming in her when alluding explanatorily latent knowledge by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant lapse

with what success had he attempted direct instruction

she followed not all a part of the whole gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise with care repeated with greater difficulty remembered forgot with ease with misgiving reremembered rerepeated with error

what system had proved more effective

indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest

example

she disliked umbrella with rain he liked woman with umbrella she disliked new hat with rain he liked woman with new hat he bought new hat with rain she carried umbrella with new hat

accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce

three seekers of the pure truth moses of egypt moses maimonides author of more neubkim guide of the perplexed and moses mendelssohn of such eminence that from moses of egypt to moses mendelssohn there arose none like moses maimonides

what statement was made under correction by bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth by name aristotle mentioned with permission by stephen

that the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher name uncertain

were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned

felix bartholdy mendelssohn composer baruch spinoza philosopher mendoza pugilist ferdinand lassalle reformer duellist

what fragments of verse from the ancient hebrew and ancient irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest

by stephen suil suil suil arun suil go siocair agus suil go cuin walk walk walk your way walk in safety walk with care

by bloom kifeloch harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate

how was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison

on the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style entitled sweets of sin produced by bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table with a pencil supplied by stephen stephen wrote the irish characters for gee eh dee em simple and modified and bloom in turn wrote the hebrew characters ghimel aleph daleth and in the absence of mem a substituted goph explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers videlicet 3 14 and 100

was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages the extinct and the revived theoretical or practical

theoretical being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary

what points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them

the presence of guttural sounds diacritic aspirations epenthetic and servile letters in both languages their antiquity both having been taught on the plain of shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by fenius farsaigh descendant of noah progenitor of israel and ascendant of heber and heremon progenitors of ireland their archeological genealogical hagiographical exegetical homilectic toponomastic historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees torah talmud mischna and ghemara massor pentateuch book of the dun cow book of ballymote garland of howth book of kells their dispersal persecution survival and revival the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto s mary's abbey and masshouse adam and eve's tavern the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts the restoration in chanan david of zion and the possibility of irish political autonomy or devolution

what anthem did bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple ethnically irreductible consummation

kolod balejwaw pnimali
nefesch jehudi homijah

why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich

in consequence of defective mnemotechnic

how did the chanter compensate for this deficiency by a periphrastic version of the general text

in what common study did their mutual reflections merge

the increasing simplification traceable from the egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the greek and roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions semitic and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing celtic

did the guest comply with his host's request

doubly by appending his signature in irish and roman characters

what was stephen's auditive sensation

he heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past

what was bloom's visual sensation

he saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future

what were stephen's and bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities

visually stephen's the traditional figure of hypostasis depicted by johannes damascenus lentulus romanus and epiphanius monachus as leucodermic sesquipedalian with winedark hair

auditively bloom's the traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe

what future careers had been possible for bloom in the past and with what exemplars

in the church roman anglican or nonconformist exemplars the very reverend john conmee sj the reverend t salmon dd provost of trinity college dr alexander j dowie at the bar english or irish exemplars seymour bushe kc rufus isaacs kc on the stage modern or shakespearean exemplars charles wyndham high comedian osmond tearle 1901 exponent of shakespeare

did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme

reassuringly their place where none could hear them talk being secluded reassured the decocted beverages allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa having been consumed

recite the first major part of this chanted legend

d little harry hughes and his schoolfellows all went out for to play ball
and the very first ball little harry hughes played
he drove it o'er the jew's garden wall
and the very second ball little harry hughes played
he broke the jew's windows all

how did the son of rudolph receive this first part

with unmixed feeling smiling a jew he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window

recite the second part minor of the legend

then out there came the jew's daughter
and she all dressed in green
come back come back you pretty little boy
and play your ball again'

i can't come back and i won't come back
without my schoolfellows all
for if my master he did hear
he'd make it a sorry ball'

she took him by the lilywhite hand
and led him along the hall
until she led him to a room
where none could hear him call

she took a penknife out of her pocket
and cut off his little head
and now he'll play his ball no more
for he lies among the dead

how did the father of millicent receive this second part

with mixed feelings unsmiling he heard and saw with wonder a jew's daughter all dressed in green

condense stephen's commentary
one of all the least of all is the victim predestined once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny it comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting it leads him to a strange habitation to a secret infidel apartment and there implacable immolates him consenting

why was the host victim predestined sad

he wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told

why was the host reluctant unresisting still

in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy

why was the host secret infidel silent

he weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder the incitation of the hierarchy the superstition of the populace the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity the envy of opulence the influence of retaliation the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism

from which if any of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune

from hypnotic suggestion once waking he had not recognised his sleeping apartment more than once waking he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds from somnambulism once sleeping his body had risen crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and having attained its destination there curled unheated in night attire had lain sleeping

had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family

twice in holles street and in ontario terrace his daughter millicent milly at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression

what other infantile memories had he of her

15 june 1889 a querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion a child renamed padney socks she shook with shocks her moneybox counted his three free moneypenny buttons one tloo tlee a doll a boy a sailor she cast away blond born of two dark she had blond ancestry remote a violation herr hauptmann hainau austrian army proximate a hallucination lieutenant mulvey british navy

what endemic characteristics were present

conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which though interrupted would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals

what memories had he of her adolescence

she relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess on the duke's lawn entreated by an english visitor she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image objection not stated on the south circular road in the company of elsa potter followed by an individual of sinister aspect she went half way down stamer street and turned abruptly back reason of change not stated on the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from mullingar county westmeath making a brief allusion to a local student faculty and year not stated

did that first division portending a second division afflict him

less than he had imagined more than he had hoped

what second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently

a temporary departure of his cat

why similarly why differently

similarly because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male mullingar student or of a healing herb valerian differently because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation

in other respects were their differences similar

in passivity in economy in the instinct of tradition in unexpectedness

as

inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her cf neckarching cat moreover on the free surface of the lake in stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit describing concentric circles of waterrings indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish cf mousewatching cat again in order to remember the date combatants issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair cf earwashing cat furthermore silly milly she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been joseph to whom which she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it he had appeared to have accepted cf hearthdreaming cat hence in passivity in economy in the instinct of tradition in unexpectedness their differences were similar

in what way had he utilised gifts 1 an owl 2 a clock given as matrimonial auguries to interest and to instruct her

as object lessons to explain 1 the nature and habits of oviparous animals the possibility of aerial flight certain abnormalities of vision the secular process of imbalsamation 2 the principle of the pendulum exemplified in bob wheelgear and regulator the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable indicators on an unmoving dial the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination videlicet 5 511 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression

in what manners did she reciprocate

she remembered on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown derby porcelain ware she provided at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities anticipating his desires she admired a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science the moiety the quarter a thousandth part

what proposal did bloom diambulist father of milly somnambulist make to stephen noctambulist

to pass in repose the hours intervening between thursday proper and friday normal on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess

what various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such extemporisation

for the guest security of domicile and seclusion of study for the host rejuvenation of intelligence vicarious satisfaction for the hostess disintegration of obsession acquisition of correct italian pronunciation

why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter

because the way to daughter led through mother the way to mother through daughter

to what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer

if he had known the late mrs emily sinico accidentally killed at sydney parade railway station 14 october 1903

what inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host

a statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of mrs mary dedalus born goulding 26 june 1903 vigil of the anniversary of the decease of rudolph bloom born virag

was the proposal of asylum accepted

promptly inexplicably with amicability gratefully it was declined

what exchange of money took place between host and guest

the former returned to the latter without interest a sum of money 17s0 one pound seven shillings advanced by the latter to the former

what counterproposals were alternately advanced accepted modified declined restated in other terms reaccepted ratified reconfirmed

to inaugurate a prearranged course of italian instruction place the residence of the instructed to inaugurate a course of vocal instruction place the residence of the instructress to inaugurate a series of static semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues places the residence of both speakers if both speakers were resident in the same place the ship hotel and tavern 6 lower abbey street w and e connery proprietors the national library of ireland 10 kildare street the national maternity hospital 29 30 and 31 holles street a public garden the vicinity of a place of worship a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences if both speakers were resident in different places

what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions

the irreparability of the past once at a performance of albert hengler's circus in the rotunda rutland square dublin an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he bloom was his the clown's papa the imprevidibility of the future once in the summer of 1898 he bloom had marked a florin 2s with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by j and t davy family grocers 1 charlemont mall grand canal for circulation on the waters of civic finance for possible circuitous or direct return

was the clown bloom's son

no

had bloom's coin returned

never

why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him

because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity

he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating these conditions

there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct from human law as integral parts of the human whole the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence the agonies of birth and death the monotonous menstruation of simian and particularly human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause inevitable accidents at sea in mines and factories certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations innate lunacy and congenital criminality decimating epidemics catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay

why did he desist from speculation

because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed

did stephen participate in his dejection

he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void

was this affirmation apprehended by bloom

not verbally substantially

what comforted his misapprehension

that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void

i n what order of precedence with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected

lighted candle in stick borne by
bloom
diaconal hat on ashplant borne by
stephen

with what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm

the 113th modus peregrinus in exitu isral de egypto domus jacob de populo barbaro

what did each do at the door of egress

bloom set the candlestick on the floor stephen put the hat on his head

for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress

for a cat

what spectacle confronted them when they first the host then the guest emerged silently doubly dark from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden

the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit

with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations

meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipent lunation approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of sirius alpha in canis major 10 lightyears 57000000000000 miles distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet of arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in 1901 of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years threescore and ten of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity

were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast

of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth beneath removable stones in hives and mounds of microbes germs bacteria bacilli spermatozoa of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies each in continuity its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progress were carried far enough nought nowhere was never reached

why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result

because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places eg the 9th power of the 9th power of 9 that the result having been obtained 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions billions the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers

did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race given in species and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer easier of solution

of a different order of difficulty conscious that the human organism normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian mercurial veneral jovian saturnian neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity

and the problem of possible redemption
the minor was proved by the major

which various features of the constellations were in turn considered

the various colours significant of various degrees of vitality white yellow crimson vermilion cinnabar their degrees of brilliancy their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th their positions the waggoner's star walsingham way the chariot of david the annular cinctures of saturn the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns the interdependent gyrations of double suns the independent synchronous discoveries of galileo simon marius piazzi le verrier herschel galle the systematisations attempted by bode and kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion the sidereal origin of meteoric stones the libyan floods on mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of s lawrence martyr 10 august the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms the posited influence of celestial on human bodies the appearance of a star 1st magnitude of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns about the period of the birth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of cassiopeia and of a star 2nd magnitude of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about the period of the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of presumably similar origin which had effectively or presumably appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of andromeda about the period of the birth of stephen dedalus and in and from the constellation of auriga some years after the birth and death of rudolph bloom junior and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons the attendant phenomena of eclipses solar and lunar from immersion to emersion abatement of wind transit of shadow taciturnity of winged creatures emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals persistence of infernal light obscurity of terrestrial waters pallor of human beings

his bloom's logical conclusion having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error

that it was not a heaventree not a heavengrot not a heavenbeast not a heavenman that it was a utopia there being no known method from the known to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositions probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space remobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its future spectators had entered actual present existence

was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle

indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet

did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters

it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy the lake of dreams the sea of rains the gulf of dews the ocean of fecundity

what special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman

her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations her nocturnal predominance her satellitic dependence her luminary reflection her constancy under all her phases rising and setting by her appointed times waxing and waning the forced invariability of her aspect her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation her potency over effluent and refluent waters her power to enamour to mortify to invest with beauty to render insane to incite to and aid delinquency the tranquil inscrutability of her visage the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity her omens of tempest and of calm the stimulation of her light her motion and her presence the admonition of her craters her arid seas her silence her splendour when visible her attraction when invisible

what visible luminous sign attracted bloom's who attracted stephen's gaze

in the second storey rere of his bloom's house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by frank o'hara window blind curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer 16 aungier street

how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person his wife marion molly bloom denoted by a visible splendid sign a lamp

with indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations with subdued affection and admiration with description with impediment with suggestion

both then were silent

silent each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces

were they indefinitely inactive

at stephen's suggestion at bloom's instigation both first stephen then bloom in penumbra urinated their sides contiguous their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition their gazes first bloom's then stephen's elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow

similarly

the trajectories of their first sequent then simultaneous urinations were dissimilar bloom's longer less irruent in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at high school 1880 had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution 210 scholars stephen's higher more sibilant who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure

what different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other

to bloom the problems of irritability tumescence rigidity reactivity dimension sanitariness pelosity to stephen the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of jesus circumcised 1st january holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce the carnal bridal ring of the holy roman catholic apostolic church conserved in calcata were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails

what celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed

a star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from vega in the lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the tress of berenice towards the zodiacal sign of leo

how did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer

by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left withdrawing a bolt from its staple pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress

how did they take leave one of the other in separation

standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base the lines of their valedictory arms meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles

what sound accompanied the union of their tangent the disunion of their respectively centrifugal and centripetal hands

the sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of saint george

what echoes of that sound were by both and each heard

by stephen

liliata rutilantium turma circumdet
iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat

by bloom

heigho heigho
heigho heigho

where were the several members of the company which with bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from sandymount in the south to glasnevin in the north

martin cunningham in bed jack power in bed simon dedalus in bed tom kernan in bed ned lambert in bed joe hynes in bed john henry menton in bed bernard corrigan in bed patsy dignam in bed paddy dignam in the grave

alone what did bloom hear

the double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth the double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane

alone what did bloom feel

the cold of interstellar space thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of fahrenheit centigrade or raumur the incipient intimations of proximate dawn

of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him

of companions now in various manners in different places defunct percy apjohn killed in action modder river philip gilligan phthisis jervis street hospital matthew f kane accidental drowning dublin bay philip moisel pyemia heytesbury street michael hart phthisis mater misericordi hospital patrick dignam apoplexy sandymount

what prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain

the disparition of three final stars the diffusion of daybreak the apparition of a new solar disk

had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena

once in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of luke doyle kimmage he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon seated on a wall his gaze turned in the direction of mizrach the east

he remembered the initial paraphenomena

more active air a matutinal distant cock ecclesiastical clocks at various points avine music the isolated tread of an early wayfarer the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon

did he remain

with deep inspiration he returned retraversing the garden reentering the passage reclosing the door with brief suspiration he reassumed the candle reascended the stairs reapproached the door of the front room hallfloor and reentered

what suddenly arrested his ingress

the right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered

describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furnitures

a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa the walnut sideboard a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table

describe them

one a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere which repelled in recoil had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration the other a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves placed directly opposite the former its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush

what significances attached to these two chairs

significances of similitude of posture of symbolism of circumstantial evidence of testimonial supermanence

what occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard

a vertical piano cadby with exposed keyboard its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes its musicrest supporting the music in the key of g natural for voice and piano of love's old sweet song words by g clifton bingham composed by j l molloy sung by madam antoinette sterling open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum forte pedal animato sustained pedal ritirando close

with what sensations did bloom contemplate in rotation these objects

with strain elevating a candlestick with pain feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence with attention focusing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active with solicitation bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe with amusement remembering dr malachi mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green with pleasure repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration

his next proceeding

from an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone one inch in height placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus illustrated entitled agendath netaim unfolded the same examined it superficially rolled it into a thin cylinder ignited it in the candleflame applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion

what followed this operation

that truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense

what homothetic objects other than the candlestick stood on the mantelpiece

a timepiece of striated connemara marble stopped at the hour of 446 am on the 21 march 1896 matrimonial gift of matthew dillon a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle an embalmed owl matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper

what interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and bloom

in the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl before the mirror the matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded bloom while bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle

what composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention

the image of a solitary ipsorelative mutable aliorelative man

why solitary ipsorelative

brothers and sisters had he none
yet that man's father was his grandfather's son

why mutable aliorelative

from infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix from maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator

what final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror

the optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite

did the process of divestiture continue

sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions then inclined he disnoded the laceknots unhooked and loosened the laces took off each of his two boots for the second time detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted raised his right foot and having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender took off his right sock placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment

why with satisfaction

because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other unguinal fragments picked and lacerated by master bloom pupil of mrs ellis's juvenile school patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation

might he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock

not impossibly with 1 or 2 stripper cows 1 pike of upland hay and requisite farming implements eg an endtoend churn a turnip pulper etc

what would be his civic functions and social status among the county families and landed gentry

arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order that of gardener groundsman cultivator breeder and at the zenith of his career resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto semper paratus duly recorded in the court directory bloom leopold p m p p c k p l l d honoris cause bloomville dundrum and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence mr and mrs leopold bloom have left kingstown for england

what course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity

a course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate real and personal to the crown loyal to the highest constituted power in the land actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution the upholding of the letter of the law common statute and law merchant against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations all resuscitators by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings of venville rights obsolete by desuetude all orotund instigators of international persecution all perpetuators of international animosities all menial molestors of domestic conviviality all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality

prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth

to master percy apjohn at high school in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the irish protestant church to which his father rudolf virag later rudolph bloom had been converted from the israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the society for promoting christianity among the jews subsequently abjured by him in favour of roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888 to daniel magrane and francis wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship terminated by the premature emigration of the former he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial eg canadian expansion and the evolutionary theories of charles darwin expounded in the descent of man and the origin of species in 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by james fintan lalor john fisher murray john mitchel j f x o'brien and others the agrarian policy of michael davitt the constitutional agitation of charles stewart parnell m p for cork city the programme of peace retrenchment and reform of william ewart gladstone m p for midlothian n b and in support of his political convictions had climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on northumberland road to see the entrance 2 february 1888 into the capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20000 divided into 120 trade corporations bearing 2000 torches in escort of the marquess of ripon and john morley

what rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate purchase

were there schemes of wider scope

a scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour commissioners for the exploitation of white coal hydraulic power obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at dublin bar or at head of water at poulaphouca or powerscourt or catchment basins of main streams for the economic production of 500000 w h p of electricity a scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the north bull at dollymount and erect on the space of the foreland used for golf links and rifle ranges an asphalted esplanade with casinos booths shooting galleries hotels boardinghouses readingrooms establishments for mixed bathing a scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early morning milk a scheme for the development of irish tourist traffic in and around dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats plying in the fluvial fairway between island bridge and ringsend charabancs narrow gauge local railways and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation 10 per person per day guide trilingual included a scheme for the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over irish waterways when freed from weedbeds a scheme to connect by tramline the cattle market north circular road and prussia street with the quays sheriff street lower and east wall parallel with the link line railway laid in conjunction with the great southern and western railway line between the cattle park liffey junction and terminus of midland great western railway 43 to 45 north wall in proximity to the terminal stations or dublin branches of great central railway midland railway of england city of dublin steam packet company lancashire yorkshire railway company dublin and glasgow steam packet company glasgow dublin and londonderry steam packet company laird line british and irish steam packet company dublin and morecambe steamers london and north western railway company dublin port and docks board landing sheds and transit sheds of palgrave murphy and company steamship owners agents for steamers from mediterranean spain portugal france belgium and holland and for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the dublin united tramways company limited to be covered by graziers' fees

positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes become a natural and necessary apodosis

given a guarantee equal to the sum sought the support by deed of gift and transfer vouchers during donor's lifetime or by bequest after donor's painless extinction of eminent financiery blum pasha rothschild guggenheim hirsch montefiore morgan rockefeller possessing fortunes in 6 figures amassed during a successful life and joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done

what eventually would render him independent of such wealth

the independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore

for what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation

it was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality

his justifications

as a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at least 27ths viz 20 years passed in sleep as a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised as a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence

what did he fear

the committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions

what were habitually his final meditations

of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder a poster novelty with all extraneous accretions excluded reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life

what reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in bloom

an old man widower unkempt hair in bed with head covered sighing an infirm dog athos aconite resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia the face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison

why did bloom experience a sentiment of remorse

because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices

as

the prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots the circumcision of male infants the supernatural character of judaic scripture the ineffability of the tetragrammaron the sanctity of the sabbath

how did these beliefs and practices now appear to him

not more rational than they had then appeared not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared

what first reminiscence had he of rudolph bloom deceased

rudolph bloom deceased narrated to his son leopold bloom aged 6 a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between dublin london florence milan vienna budapest szombathely with statements of satisfaction his grandfather having seen maria theresa empress of austria queen of hungary with commercial advice having taken care of pence the pounds having taken care of themselves leopold bloom aged 6 had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of europe political and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned

had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener

in narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences

what idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia

occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper

what two phenomena of senescence were more frequent

the myopic digital calculation of coins eructation consequent upon repletion

what object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences

the endowment policy the bank passbook the certificate of the possession of scrip

reduce bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune from which these supports protected him and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity

successively in descending helotic order poverty that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts the poor rate and deputy cess collector mendicancy that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s 4d in the  sandwichman distributor of throwaways nocturnal vagrant insinuating sycophant maimed sailor blind stripling superannuated bailiff's man marfeast lickplate spoilsport pickthank eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella destitution the inmate of old man's house royal hospital kilmainham the inmate of simpson's hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight nadir of misery the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper

with which attendant indignities

the unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females the contempt of muscular males the acceptance of fragments of bread the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles worth little or nothing or less than nothing

by what could such a situation be precluded

by decease change of state by departure change of place

which preferably

the latter by the line of least resistance

what considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable

constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects the habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated the necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest

what considerations rendered it not irrational

the parties concerned uniting had increased and multiplied which being done offspring produced and educed to maturity the parties if now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication which was absurd to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties which was impossible

what considerations rendered it desirable

the attractive character of certain localities in ireland and abroad as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures

in ireland

the cliffs of moher the windy wilds of connemara lough neagh with submerged petrified city the giant's causeway fort camden and fort carlisle the golden vale of tipperary the islands of aran the pastures of royal meath brigid's elm in kildare the queen's island shipyard in belfast the salmon leap the lakes of killarney

abroad

ceylon with spicegardens supplying tea to thomas kernan agent for pulbrook robertson and co 2 mincing lane london e c 5 dame street dublin jerusalem the holy city with mosque of omar and gate of damascus goal of aspiration the straits of gibraltar the unique birthplace of marion tweedy the parthenon containing statues nude grecian divinities the wall street money market which controlled international finance the plaza de toros at la linea spain where o'hara of the camerons had slain the bull niagara over which no human being had passed with impunity the land of the eskimos eaters of soap the forbidden country of thibet from which no traveller returns the bay of naples to see which was to die the dead sea

under what guidance following what signs

at sea septentrional by night the polestar located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in ursa major produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of ursa major on land meridional a bispherical moon revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female a pillar of the cloud by day

what public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed

5 reward lost stolen or strayed from his residence 7 eccles street missing gent about 40 answering to the name of bloom leopold poldy height 5 ft 9 12 inches full build olive complexion may have since grown a beard when last seen was wearing a black suit above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery

what universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity

assumed by any or known to none everyman or noman

what tributes his

honour and gifts of strangers the friends of everyman a nymph immortal beauty the bride of noman

would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear

ever he would wander selfcompelled to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets astronomical waifs and strays to the extreme boundary of space passing from land to land among peoples amid events somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly suncompelled obey the summons of recall whence disappearing from the constellation of the northern crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger a wreaker of justice on malefactors a dark crusader a sleeper awakened with financial resources by supposition surpassing those of rothschild or of the silver king

what would render such return irrational

an unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time

what play of forces inducing inertia rendered departure undesirable

the lateness of the hour rendering procrastinatory the obscurity of the night rendering invisible the uncertainty of thoroughfares rendering perilous the necessity for repose obviating movement the proximity of an occupied bed obviating research the anticipation of warmth human tempered with coolness linen obviating desire and rendering desirable the statue of narcissus sound without echo desired desire

what advantages were possessed by an occupied as distinct from an unoccupied bed

what selfimposed enigma did bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend

the cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table

what selfinvolved enigma did bloom risen going gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments voluntarily apprehending not comprehend

who was m'intosh

what selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did bloom now having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light silently suddenly comprehend

where was moses when the candle went out

what imperfections in a perfect day did bloom walking silently successively enumerate

a provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement to obtain a certain quantity of tea from thomas kernan agent for pulbrook robertson and co 5 dame street dublin and 2 mincing lane london e c to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of hellenic female divinities to obtain admission gratuitous or paid to the performance of leah by mrs bandman palmer at the gaiety theatre 46 47 48 49 south king street

what impression of an absent face did bloom arrested silently recall

the face of her father the late major brian cooper tweedy royal dublin fusiliers of gibraltar and rehoboth dolphin's barn

what recurrent impressions of the same were possible by the hypothesis

retreating at the terminus of the great northern railway amiens street with constant uniform acceleration along parallel lines meeting at infinity if produced along parallel lines reproduced from infinity with constant uniform retardation at the terminus of the great northern railway amiens street returning

what miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him

a pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose a pair of new violet garters a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of india mull cut on generous lines redolent of opoponax jessamine and muratti's turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin folded curvilinear a camisole of baptiste with thin lace border an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk quadruple battened having capped corners with multicoloured labels initialled on its fore side in white lettering b c t brian cooper tweedy

what impersonal objects were perceived

bloom's acts

he deposited the articles of clothing on a chair removed his remaining articles of clothing took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed

how

with circumspection as invariably when entering an abode his own or not his own with solicitude the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain prudently as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adder lightly the less to disturb reverently the bed of conception and of birth of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage of sleep and of death

what did his limbs when gradually extended encounter

new clean bedlinen additional odours the presence of a human form female hers the imprint of a human form male not his some crumbs some flakes of potted meat recooked which he removed

if he had smiled why would he have smiled

to reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one each imagining himself to be first last only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity

what preceding series

assuming mulvey to be the first term of his series penrose bartell d'arcy professor goodwin julius mastiansky john henry menton father bernard corrigan a farmer at the royal dublin society's horse show maggot o'reilly matthew dillon valentine blake dillon lord mayor of dublin christopher callinan lenehan an italian organgrinder an unknown gentleman in the gaiety theatre benjamin dollard simon dedalus andrew pisser burke joseph cuffe wisdom hely alderman john hooper dr francis brady father sebastian of mount argus a bootblack at the general post office hugh e blazes boylan and so each and so on to nolast term

what were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed

reflections on his vigour a bounder corporal proportion a billsticker commercial ability a bester impressionability a boaster

why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour corporal proportion and commercial ability

because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence inflammably transmitted first with alarm then with understanding then with desire finally with fatigue with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension

with what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected

envy jealousy abnegation equanimity

envy

of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism passive but not obtuse

jealousy

because a nature full and volatile in its free state was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction because action between agents and reagents at all instants varied with inverse proportion of increase and decrease with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced if desired a fluctuation of pleasure

abnegation

in virtue of a acquaintance initiated in september 1903 in the establishment of george mesias merchant tailor and outfitter 5 eden quay b hospitality extended and received in kind reciprocated and reappropriated in person c comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity colleagual altruism and amorous egoism d extraracial attraction intraracial inhibition supraracial prerogative e an imminent provincial musical tour common current expenses net proceeds divided

equanimity

as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his her and their natured natures of dissimilar similarity as not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision with a dark sun as less reprehensible than theft highway robbery cruelty to children and animals obtaining money under false pretences forgery embezzlement misappropriation of public money betrayal of public trust malingering mayhem corruption of minors criminal libel blackmail contempt of court arson treason felony mutiny on the high seas trespass burglary jailbreaking practice of unnatural vice desertion from armed forces in the field perjury poaching usury intelligence with the king's enemies impersonation criminal assault manslaughter wilful and premeditated murder as not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances foods beverages acquired habits indulged inclinations significant disease as more than inevitable irreparable

why more abnegation than jealousy less envy than equanimity

from outrage matrimony to outrage adultery there arose nought but outrage copulation yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated

what retribution if any

assassination never as two wrongs did not make one right duel by combat no divorce not now exposure by mechanical artifice automatic bed or individual testimony concealed ocular witness not yet suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained selfinflicted not impossibly if any positively connivance introduction of emulation material a prosperous rival agency of publicity moral a successful rival agent of intimacy depreciation alienation humiliation separation protecting the one separated from the other protecting separator from both

by what reflections did he a conscious reactor against the void incertitude justify to himself his sentiments

the preordained frangibility of the hymen the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation of the thing done the fallaciously inferred debility of the female the muscularity of the male the variations of ethical codes the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition parsed as masculine subject monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition parsed as feminine subject auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent in the passive voice the continued product of seminators by generation the continual production of semen by distillation the futility of triumph or protest or vindication the inanity of extolled virtue the lethargy of nescient matter the apathy of the stars

in what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections reduced to their simplest forms converge

satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored the land of the midnight sun the islands of the blessed the isles of greece the land of promise of adipose posterior female hemispheres redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression expressive of mute immutable mature animality

the visible signs of antesatisfaction

an approximate erection a solicitous adversion a gradual elevation a tentative revelation a silent contemplation

then

he kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump on each plump melonous hemisphere in their mellow yellow furrow with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation

the visible signs of postsatisfaction

a silent contemplation a tentative velation a gradual abasement a solicitous aversion a proximate erection

what followed this silent action

somnolent invocation less somnolent recognition incipient excitation catechetical interrogation

with what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation

negative he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between martha clifford and henry flower the public altercation at in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of bernard kiernan and co limited 8 9 and 10 little britain street the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of gertrude gerty surname unknown positive he included mention of a performance by mrs bandman palmer of leah at the gaiety theatre 46 47 48 49 south king street an invitation to supper at wynn's murphy's hotel 35 36 and 37 lower abbey street a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled sweets of sin anonymous author a gentleman of fashion a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display the victim since completely recovered being stephen dedalus professor and author eldest surviving son of simon dedalus of no fixed occupation an aeronautical feat executed by him narrator in the presence of a witness the professor and author aforesaid with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility

was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications

absolutely

which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration

stephen dedalus professor and author

what limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration

by the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth 8 september 1870 viz 8 october and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 june 1889 having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 september of the same year and complete carnal intercourse with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ having last taken place 5 weeks previous viz 27 november 1893 to the birth on 29 december 1893 of second and only male issue deceased 9 january 1894 aged 11 days there remained a period of 10 years 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ by the narrator a limitation of activity mental and corporal inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty indicated by catamenic hemorrhage of the female issue of narrator and listener 15 september 1903 there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females listener and issue complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed

how

by various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither the place where the time at which the duration for which the object with which in the case of temporary absences projected or effected

what moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible thoughts

the upcast reflection of a lamp and shade an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow

in what directions did listener and narrator lie

listener s e by e narrator n w by w on the 53rd parallel of latitude n and 6th meridian of longitude w at an angle of 45 to the terrestrial equator

in what state of rest or motion

at rest relatively to themselves and to each other in motion being each and both carried westward forward and rereward respectively by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space

in what posture

listener reclined semilaterally left left hand under head right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg flexed in the attitude of geatellus fulfilled recumbent big with seed narrator reclined laterally left with right and left legs flexed the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph made by percy apjohn the childman weary the manchild in the womb

ladies and gentlemen it's time to hear my sentiments
i'm hotter than a kettle and my pen's full of adrenaline
i stopped takin' that medicine the dust is finally settlin'
practice close to perfect nobody is rhyming better than
mad child spewing a monstrosity of anguish
countrymen are tryin' but they're not talkin' my language
i rap to cover up the pain just like a fuckin' bandage
emotions like the layers on a sandwich i peel 'em like a mandarin
these young punks i'm schoolin' em like cambridge
slap these appetizers i'm the motherfuckin' main dish
first they're on my mind but then they're fallin' off like dandruff
now they call me a 'white devil' like colonel sanders
shit i'm the fire on both ends of a burnin' candle
i'll retire when jesus come back in a cloak and dirty sandals
even then still be rappin' up in heaven beside the manger
other rappers are in danger i'm the motherfuckin' misguided angel

verse 2 prevail
mp4 rev i make the files wave
classic tales of revenge my friend i will spit on your grave
kids they got no styles today gray and white and red and black
when i attack i send 'em back without their fuckin' head intact
think about that that's a risk battle axes bats and fists
wilson fisk rapping kingpin fastest engine three man blitz
the pits and pendulums of life are barriers to break through
so barricade yourself inside your house before i take you
welcome to lakeview it's a great view from the padded cell
cannibal crush we will prevail and the misguided angel's bad as hell
like the bat out of hell on a motorbike
with a spike on the helmet on the road to life
give 'em the light little parasites pacific rim got 'em in my sights
caught in the crosshairs you're gonna take a loss here
there's lots of air but you can't breathe and see it can't believe it
your eyes are playin' tricks amazing that you still exist
you think you're superman then say my name backwards like mxyzptlk

verse 3 ill bill
i spit the fire maniacal vile were wire proof
die with your boots on and a gun in your hand i approve
my uncle would too motherfuck you
motherfucker motherfuck everybody in your crew
or anybody who not ridin' with us to the fullest extent
put you under cement in the jungle with debt
smiles of murder and laughs of pain
when we were kids we'd act insane now we grown considerate the rain
brooklyn new york they say we sound like crooks when we talk
and they probably right you probably get yourself juxed with a fork
if you steppin' correct though everything is copasetic
but most these rap though guys is so pathetic
we don't start nothin' but yo we always down to finish it
humble to the rumble cause we handle our business kid
nothin' to brag about we just built like that
simmer down homie you could get killed like that

verse 4 slaine
hold up hold up police are on my dick they don't harass me
bitches on my dick so if i'm married they don't ask me
i explode she swallow my load she take a taxi
don't forget your cellphone and fix your makeup ashley
im laughing watchin' you split talkin' your shit
whisper underneath your breath leopard dungarees and mesh shit
my comrades are conniving 
my bad habits are violent i need a padded asylum
i'm too far gone thinking of departuring
my pride paid for what my ignorance was costin' me
the rep got bigger figured everyone was watching me
they looked at me the underdog i took this shit impossibly
throw the fucking bottle back and toss a molotov on me
holler back i played this job for keeps and made a boss of me
i reek of charisma can't get it off me
i serenade the whole world and sing it offkey
verse 5 vinnie paz
you see the guns is large the bullets hotter than suns and stars
y'all are pussy like love songs it's from the debarge
when my father died he put his fuckin' son in charge
and he was a g so that made me the son of god
and that mean nobody in my family is gonna starve
that mean nobody can trap me have me under bars
boxcutter paz leave you with a hundred scars
cops on the ave evil as a hundred tzars
i'm a hypocrite sendin' mixed messages

harder than servin' 20 backtoback sentences

                              mademoiselle de forcheville

   it was not that i was not still in love with albertine but no longer in the same fashion as in the final phase no it was in the fashion of the earliest times when everything that had any connexion with her places or people made me feel a curiosity in which there was more charm than suffering and indeed i was quite well aware now that before i forgot her altogether before i reached the initial stage of indifference i should have like a traveller who returns by the same route to his startingpoint to traverse in the return direction all the sentiments through which i had passed before arriving at my great love but these fragments these moments of the past are not immobile they have retained the terrible force the happy ignorance of the hope that was then yearning towards a time which has now become the past but which a hallucination makes us for a moment mistake retrospectively for the future i read a letter from albertine in which she had said that she was coming to see me that evening and i felt for an instant the joy of expectation in these return journeys along the same line from a place to which we shall never return when we recall the names the appearance of all the places which we have passed on the outward journey it happens that while our train is halting at one of the stations we feel for an instant the illusion that we are setting off again but in the direction of the place from which we have come as on the former journey soon the illusion vanishes but for an instant we felt ourselves carried away once again such is the cruelty of memory

   at times the reading of a novel that was at all sad carried me sharply back for certain novels are like great but temporary bereavements they abolish our habits bring us in contact once more with the reality of life but for a few hours only like a nightmare since the force of habit the oblivion that it creates the gaiety that it restores to us because our brain is powerless to fight against it and to recreate the truth prevails to an infinite extent over the almost hypnotic suggestion of a good book which like all suggestions has but a transient effect

   and yet if we cannot before returning to the state of indifference from which we started dispense ourselves from covering in the reverse direction the distances which we had traversed in order to arrive at love the trajectory the line that we follow are not of necessity the same they have this in common that they are not direct because oblivion is no more capable than love of progressing along a straight line but they do not of necessity take the same paths and on the path which i was taking on my return journey there were in the course of a confused passage three haltingpoints which i remember because of the light that shone round about me when i was already nearing my goal stages which i recall especially doubtless because i perceived in them things which had no place in my love for albertine or at most were attached to it only to the extent to which what existed already in our heart before a great passion associates itself with it whether by feeding it or by fighting it or by offering to our analytical mind a contrast with it

   the first of these haltingpoints began with the coming of winter on a fine sunday which was also all saints day when i had ventured out of doors as i came towards the bois i recalled with sorrow how albertine had come back to join me from the trocadro for it was the same day only without albertine with sorrow and yet not without pleasure all the same for the repetition in a minor key in a despairing tone of the same motif that had filled my day in the past the absence even of franoises telephone message of that arrival of albertine which was not something negative but the suppression in reality of what i had recalled of what had given the day a sorrowful aspect made of it something more beautiful than a simple unbroken day because what was no longer there what had been torn from it remained stamped upon it as on a mould

   in the bois i hummed phrases from vinteuils sonata i was no longer hurt by the thought that albertine had fooled me for almost all my memories of her had entered into that secondary chemical state in which they no longer cause any anxious oppression of the heart but rather comfort now and then at the passages which she used to play most often when she was in the habit of uttering some reflexion which i had thought charming at the time of suggesting some reminiscence i said to myself poor little girl but without melancholy merely adding to the musical phrase an additional value a value that was so to speak historic and curious like that which the portrait of charles i by van dyck so beautiful already in itself acquires from the fact that it found its way into the national collection because of mme du barrys desire to impress the king when the little phrase before disappearing altogether dissolved into its various elements in which it floated still for a moment in scattered fragments it was not for me as it had been for swann a messenger from albertine who was vanishing it was not altogether the same association of ideas that the little phrase had aroused in me as in swann i had been impressed most of all by the elaboration the attempts the repetitions the outcome of a phrase which persisted throughout the sonata as that love had persisted throughout my life and now when i realised how day by day one element after another of my love departed the jealous side of it then some other drifted gradually back in a vague remembrance to the feeble bait of the first outset it was my love that i seemed in the scattered notes of the little phrase to see dissolving before my eyes

   as i followed the paths separated by undergrowth carpeted with a grass that diminished daily the memory of a drive during which albertine had been by my side in the carriage from which she had returned home with me during which i felt that she was enveloping my life floated now round about me in the vague mist of the darkening branches in the midst of which the setting sun caused to gleam as though suspended in the empty air a horizontal web embroidered with golden leaves moreover my heart kept fluttering at every moment as happens to anyone in whose eyes a rooted idea gives to every woman who has halted at the end of a path the appearance the possible identity of the woman of whom he is thinking it is perhaps she we turn round the carriage continues on its way and we do not return to the spot these leaves i did not merely behold them with the eyes of my memory they interested me touched me like those purely descriptive pages into which an artist to make them more complete introduces a fiction a whole romance and this work of nature thus assumed the sole charm of melancholy which was capable of reaching my heart the reason for this charm seemed to me to be that i was still as much in love with albertine as ever whereas the true reason was on the contrary that oblivion was continuing to make such headway in me that the memory of albertine was no longer painful to me that is to say it had changed but however clearly we may discern our impressions as i then thought that i could discern the reason for my melancholy we are unable to trace them back to their more remote meaning like those maladies the history of which the doctor hears his patient relate to him by the help of which he works back to a more profound cause of which the patient is unaware similarly our impressions our ideas have only a symptomatic value my jealousy being held aloof by the impression of charm and agreeable sadness which i was feeling my senses reawakened once again as when i had ceased to see gilberte the love of woman arose in me rid of any exclusive association with any particular woman already loved and floated like those spirits that have been liberated by previous destructions and stray suspended in the springtime air asking only to be allowed to embody themselves in a new creature nowhere do there bud so many flowers forgetmenot though they be styled as in a cemetery i looked at the girls with whom this fine day so countlessly blossomed as i would have looked at them long ago from mme de villeparisiss carriage or from the carriage in which upon a similar sunday i had come there with albertine at once the glance which i had just cast at one or other of them was matched immediately by the curious stealthy enterprising glance reflecting unimaginable thoughts which albertine had furtively cast at them and which duplicating my own with a mysterious swift steelblue wing wafted along these paths which had hitherto been so natural the tremor of an unknown element with which my own desire would not have sufficed to animate them had it remained alone for it to me contained nothing that was unknown

   moreover at balbec when i had first longed to know albertine was it not because she had seemed to me typical of those girls the sight of whom had so often brought me to a standstill in the streets upon country roads and because she might furnish me with a specimen of their life and was it not natural that now the cooling star of my love in which they were condensed should explode afresh in this scattered dust of nebulae they all of them seemed to me albertines  the image that i carried inside me making me find copies of her everywhere  and indeed at the turning of an avenue the girl who was getting into a motorcar recalled her so strongly was so exactly of the same figure that i asked myself for an instant whether it were not she that i had just seen whether people had not been deceiving me when they sent me the report of her death i saw her again thus at the corner of an avenue as perhaps she had been at balbec getting into a car in the same way when she was so full of confidence in life and this other girls action in climbing into the car i did not merely record with my eyes as one of those superficial forms which occur so often in the course of a walk become a sort of permament action it seemed to me to extend also into the past in the direction of the memory which had been superimposed upon it and which pressed so deliciously so sadly against my heart but by this time the girl had vanished

   a little farther on i saw a group of three girls slightly older young women perhaps whose fashionable energetic style corresponded so closely with what had attracted me on the day when i first saw albertine and her friends that i hastened in pursuit of these three new girls and when they stopped a carriage looked frantically in every direction for another i found one but it was too late i did not overtake them a few days later however as i was coming home i saw emerging from the portico of our house the three girls whom i had followed in the bois they were absolutely the two dark ones especially save that they were slightly older the type of those young ladies who so often seen from my window or encountered in the street had made me form a thousand plans fall in love with life and whom i had never been able to know the fair one had a rather more delicate almost an invalid air which appealed to me less it was she nevertheless that was responsible for my not contenting myself with glancing at them for a moment but becoming rooted to the ground staring at them with a scrutiny of the sort which by their fixity which nothing can distract their application as though to a problem seem to be conscious that the true object is hidden far beyond what they behold i should doubtless have allowed them to disappear as i had allowed so many others had not at the moment when they passed by me the fair one  was it because i was scrutinising them so closely  darted a stealthy glance at myself than having passed me and turning her head a second glance which fired my blood however as she ceased to pay attention to myself and resumed her conversation with her friends my ardour would doubtless have subsided had it not been increased a hundredfold by the following incident when i asked the porter who they were they asked for mme la duchesse he informed me i think that only one of them knows her and that the others were simply seeing her to the door heres the name i dont know whether ive taken it down properly and i read mlle dporcheville which it was easy to correct todporcheville that is to say the name more or less so far as i could remember of the girl of excellent family vaguely connected with the guermantes whom robert had told me that he had met in a disorderly house and with whom he had had relations i now understood the meaning of her glance why she had turned round without letting her companions see how often i had thought about her imagining her in the light of the name that robert had given me and lo and behold i had seen her in no way different from her friends save for that concealed glance which established between me and herself a secret entry into the parts of her life which evidently were concealed from her friends and which made her appear more accessible  almost half my own  more gentle than girls of noble birth generally are in the mind of this girl between me and herself there was in advance the common ground of the hours that we might have spent together had she been free to make an appointment with me was it not this that her glance had sought to express to me with an eloquence that was intelligible to myself alone my heart throbbed until it almost burst i could not have given an exact description of mlle dporchevilles appearance i could picture vaguely a fair complexion viewed from the side but i was madly in love with her all of a sudden i became aware that i was reasoning as though of the three girls mlle dporcheville could be only the fair one who had turned round and had looked at me twice but the porter had not told me this i returned to his lodge questioned him again he told me that he could not enlighten me but that he would ask his wife who had seen them once before she was busy at the moment scrubbing the service stair which of us has not experienced in the course of his life these uncertainties more or less similar to mine and all alike delicious a charitable friend to whom we describe a girl that we have seen at a ball concludes from our description that she must be one of his friends and invites us to meet her but among so many girls and with no guidance but a mere verbal portrait may there not have been some mistake the girl whom we are about to meet will she not be a different girl from her whom we desire or on the contrary are we not going to see holding out her hand to us with a smile precisely the girl whom we hoped that she would be this latter case which is frequent enough without being justified always by arguments as conclusive as this with respect to mlle dporcheville arises from a sort of intuition and also from that wind of fortune which favours us at times then when we catch sight of her we say to ourself that is indeed the girl i recall that among the little band of girls who used to parade along the beach i had guessed correctly which was named albertine simonet this memory caused me a keen but transient pang and while the porter went in search of his wife my chief anxiety  as i thought of mlle dporcheville and since in those minutes spent in waiting in which a name a detail of information which we have we know not why fitted to a face finds itself free for an instant ready if it shall adhere to a new face to render retrospectively the original face as to which it had enlightened us strange innocent imperceptible  was that the porters wife was perhaps going to inform me that mlle dporcheville was on the contrary one of the two dark girls in that event there would vanish the being in whose existence i believed whom i already loved whom i now thought only of possessing that fair and sly mlle dporcheville whom the fatal answer must then separate into two distinct elements which i had arbitrarily united after the fashion of a novelist who blends together diverse elements borrowed from reality in order to create an imaginary character elements which taken separately  the name failing to corroborate the supposed intention of the glance  lost all their meaning in that case my arguments would be stultified but how greatly they found themselves on the contrary strengthened when the porter returned to tell me that mlle dporcheville was indeed the fair girl

   from that moment i could no longer believe in a similarity of names the coincidence was too remarkable that of these three girls one should be named mlle dporcheville that she should be precisely and this was the first convincing proof of my supposition the one who had gazed at me in that way almost smiling at me and that it should not be she who frequented the disorderly houses

   then began a day of wild excitement even before starting to buy all the bedizenments that i thought necessary in order to create a favourable impression when i went to call upon mme de guermantes two days later when the porter had informed me the young lady would be coming again to see the duchess in whose house i should thus find a willing girl and make an appointment or i should easily be able to take her into a corner for a moment i began so as to be on the safe side by telegraphing to robert to ask him for the girls exact name and for a description of her hoping to have his reply within fortyeight hours i did not think for an instant of anything else not even of albertine determined whatever might happen to me in the interval even if i had to be carried down in a chair were i too ill to walk to pay a long call upon the duchess if i telegraphed to saintloup it was not that i had any lingering doubt as to the identity of the person or that the girl whom i had seen and the girl of whom he had spoken were still distinct personalities in my mind i had no doubt whatever that they were the same person but in my impatience at the enforced interval of fortyeight hours it was a pleasure it gave me already a sort of secret power over her to receive a telegram concerning her filled with detailed information at the telegraph office as i drafted my message with the animation of a man who is fired by hope i remarked how much less disconcerted i was now than in my boyhood and in facing mlle dporcheville than i had been in facing gilberte from the moment in which i had merely taken the trouble to write out my telegram the clerk had only to take it from me the swiftest channels of electric communication to transmit it across the extent of france and the mediterranean and all roberts sensual past would be set to work to identify the person whom i had seen in the street would be placed at the service of the romance which i had sketched in outline and to which i need no longer give a thought for his answer would undertake to bring about a happy ending before twentyfour hours had passed whereas in the old days brought home by franoise from the champselyses brooding alone in the house over my impotent desires unable to employ the practical devices of civilisation i loved like a savage or indeed for i was not even free to move about like  flower from this moment i was in a continual fever a request from my father that i would go away with him for a couple of days which would have obliged me to forego my visit to the duchess filled me with such rage and desperation that my mother interposed and persuaded my father to allow me to remain in paris but for many hours my anger was unable to subside while my desire for mlle dporcheville was increased a hundredfold by the obstacle that had been placed between us by the fear which i had felt for a moment that those hours at which i smiled in constant anticipation of my call upon mme de guermantes as at an assured blessing of which nothing could deprive me might not occur certain philosophers assert that the outer world does not exist and that it is in ourselves that we develop our life however that may be love even in its humblest beginnings is a striking example of how little reality means to us had i been obliged to draw from memory a portrait of mlle dporcheville to furnish a description an indication of her or even to recognise her in the street i should have found it impossible i had seen her in profile on the move she had struck me as being simple pretty tall and fair i could not have said anything more but all the reactions of desire of anxiety of the mortal blow struck by the fear of not seeing her if my father took me away all these things associated with an image which after all i did not remember and as to which it was enough that i knew it to be pleasant already constituted a state of love finally on the following morning after a night of happy sleeplessness i received saintloups telegram de lorgeville de preposition orge the grain barley ville town small dark plump is at present in switzerland it was not she

   a moment before franoise brought me the telegram my mother had come into my room with my letters had laid them carelessly on my bed as though she were thinking of something else and withdrawing at once to leave me by myself she had smiled as she left the room and i who was familiar with my dear mothers little subterfuges and knew that one could always read the truth in her face without any fear of being mistaken if one took as a key to the cipher her desire to give pleasure to other people i smiled and thought there must be something interesting for me in the post and mamma has assumed that indifferent air so that my surprise may be complete and so as not to be like the people who take away half your pleasure by telling you of it beforehand and she has not stayed with me because she is afraid that in my pride i may conceal the pleasure that i shall feel and so feel it less keenly meanwhile as she reached the door she met franoise who was coming into the room the telegram in her hand as soon as she had handed it to me my mother had forced franoise to turn back and had taken her out of the room startled offended and surprised for franoise considered that her office conferred the privilege of entering my room at any hour of the day and of remaining there if she chose but already upon her features astonishment and anger had vanished beneath the dark and sticky smile of a transcendent pity and a philosophical irony a viscous liquid that was secreted in order to heal her wound by her outraged selfesteem so that she might not feel herself despised she despised us also she considered that we were masters that is to say capricious creatures who do not shine by their intelligence and take pleasure in imposing by fear upon clever people upon servants so as to shew that they are the masters absurd tasks such as that of boiling water when there is illness in the house of mopping the floor of my room with a damp cloth and of leaving it at the very moment when they intended to remain in it mamma had left the post by my side so that i might not overlook it but i could see that there was nothing but newspapers no doubt there was some article by a writer whom i admired which as he wrote seldom would be a surprise to me i went to the window and drew back the curtains above the pale and misty daylight the sky was all red as at the same hour are the newly lighted fires in kitchens and the sight of it filled me with hope and with a longing to pass the night in a train and awake at the little country station where i had seen the milkgirl with the rosy cheeks

   i opened the figaro what a bore the very first article had the same title as the article which i had sent to the paper and which had not appeared but not merely the same title    why there were several words absolutely identical this was really too bad i must write and complain but it was not merely a few words there was the whole thing there was my signature at the foot it was my article that had appeared at last but my brain which even at this period had begun to shew signs of age and to be easily tired continued for a moment longer to reason as though it had not understood that this was my article just as we see an old man obliged to complete a movement that he has begun even if it is no longer necessary even if an unforeseen obstacle in the face of which he ought at once to draw back makes it dangerous then i considered the spiritual bread of life that a newspaper is still hot and damp from the press in the murky air of the morning in which it is distributed at break of day to the housemaids who bring it to their masters with their morning coffee a miraculous selfmultiplying bread which is at the same time one and ten thousand which remains the same for each person while penetrating innumerably into every house at once

   what i am holding in my hand is not a particular copy of the newspaper it is any one out of the ten thousand it is not merely what has been written for me it is what has been written for me and for everyone to appreciate exactly the phenomenon which is occurring at this moment in the other houses it is essential that i read this article not as its author but as one of the ordinary readers of the paper for what i held in my hand was not merely what i had written it was the symbol of its incarnation in countless minds and so in order to read it it was essential that i should cease for a moment to be its author that i should be simply one of the readers of the figaro but then came an initial anxiety would the reader who had not been forewarned catch sight of this article i open the paper carelessly as would this not forewarned reader even assuming an air of not knowing what there is this morning in my paper of being in a hurry to look at the social paragraphs and the political news but my article is so long that my eye which avoids it to remain within the bounds of truth and not to put chance on my side as a person who is waiting counts very slowly on purpose catches a fragment of it in its survey but many of those readers who notice the first article and even read it do not notice the signature i myself would be quite incapable of saying who had written the first article of the day before and i now promise myself that i will always read them including the authors name but like a jealous lover who refrains from betraying his mistress in order to believe in her fidelity i reflect sadly that my own future attention will not compel the reciprocal attention of other people and besides there are those who are going out shooting those who have left the house in a hurry and yet after all some of them will read it i do as they do i begin i may know full well that many people who read this article will find it detestable at the moment of reading it the meaning that each word conveys to me seems to me to be printed on the paper i cannot believe that each other reader as he opens his eyes will not see directly the images that i see believing the authors idea to be directly perceived by the reader whereas it is a different idea that takes shape in his mind with the simplicity of people who believe that it is the actual word which they have uttered that proceeds along the wires of the telephone at the very moment in which i mean to be a reader my mind adjusts as its author the attitude of those who will read my article if m de guermantes did not understand some sentences which would appeal to bloch he might on the other hand be amused by some reflexion which bloch would scorn thus for each part which the previous reader seemed to overlook a fresh admirer presenting himself the article as a whole was raised to the clouds by a swarm of readers and so prevailed over my own mistrust of myself which had no longer any need to analyse it the truth of the matter is that the value of an article however remarkable it may be is like that of those passages in parliamentary reports in which the words wait and see uttered by the minister derive all their importance only from their appearing in the setting the president of the council minister of the interior and of religious bodies wait and see outcry on the extreme left hear hear from the left and centre the main part of their beauty dwells in the minds of the readers and it is the original sin of this style of literature of which the famous lundis are not guiltless that their merit resides in the impression that they make on their readers it is a synthetic venus of which we have but one truncated limb if we confine ourselves to the thought of the author for it is realised in its completeness only in the minds of his readers in them it finds its fulfilment and as a crowd even a select crowd is not an artist this final seal of approval which it sets upon the article must always retain a certain element of vulgarity thus saintebeuve on a monday could imagine mme de soigne in her bed with its eight columns reading his article in the constitutionnel appreciating some charming phrase in which he had long delighted and which might never perhaps have flowed from his pen had he not thought it expedient to load his article with it in order to give it a longer range doubtless the chancellor reading it for himself would refer to it during the call which we would pay upon his old friend a little later and as he took her out that evening in his carriage the duc de noailles in his grey pantaloons would tell her what had been thought of it in society unless a word let fall by mme dherbouville had already informed her

   i saw thus at that same hour for so many people my idea or even failing my idea for those who were incapable of understanding it the repetition of my name and as it were a glorified suggestion of my personality shine upon them in a daybreak which filled me with more strength and triumphant joy than the innumerable daybreak which at that moment was blushing at every window

   i saw bloch m de guermantes legrandin extracting each in turn from every sentence the images that it enclosed at the very moment in which i endeavour to be an ordinary reader i read as an author but not as an author only in order that the impossible creature that i am endeavouring to be may combine all the contrary elements which may be most favourable to me if i read as an author i judge myself as a reader without any of the scruples that may be felt about a written text by him who confronts in it the ideal which he has sought to express in it those phrases in my article when i wrote them were so colourless in comparison with my thought so complicated and opaque in comparison with my harmonious and transparent vision so full of gaps which i had not managed to fill that the reading of them was a torture to me they had only accentuated in me the sense of my own impotence and of my incurable want of talent but now in forcing myself to be a reader if i transferred to others the painful duty of criticising me i succeeded at least in making a clean sweep of what i had attempted to do in first reading what i had written i read the article forcing myself to imagine that it was written by some one else then all my images all my reflexions all my epithets taken by themselves and without the memory of the check which they had given to my intentions charmed me by their brilliance their amplitude their depth and when i felt a weakness that was too marked taking refuge in the spirit of the ordinary and astonished reader i said to myself bah how can a reader notice that there is something missing there it is quite possible but be damned to them if they are not satisfied there are plenty of pretty passages more than they are accustomed to find and resting upon this tenthousandfold approval which supported me i derived as much sense of my own strength and hope in my own talent from the article which i was reading at that moment as i had derived distrust when what i had written addressed itself only to myself

   no sooner had i finished this comforting perusal than i who had not had the courage to reread my manuscript longed to begin reading it again immediately for there is nothing like an old article by oneself of which one can say more aptly that when one has read it one can read it again i decided that i would send franoise out to buy fresh copies in order to give them to my friends i should tell her in reality so as to touch with my finger the miracle of the multiplication of my thought and to read as though i were another person who had just opened the figaro in another copy the same sentences it was as it happened ever so long since i had seen the guermantes i must pay them next day the call which i had planned with such agitation in the hope of meeting mlle dporcheville when i telegraphed to saintloup i should find out from them what people thought of my article i imagined some female reader into whose room i would have been so glad to penetrate and to whom the newspaper would convey if not my thought which she would be incapable of understanding at least my name like a tribute to myself but these tributes paid to one whom we do not love do not enchant our heart any more than the thoughts of a mind which we are unable to penetrate reach our mind with regard to other friends i told myself that if the state of my health continued to grow worse and if i could not see them again it would be pleasant to continue to write to them so as still to have in that way access to them to speak to them between the lines to make them share my thoughts to please them to be received into their hearts i told myself this because social relations having previously had a place in my daily life a future in which they would no longer figure alarmed me and because this expedient which would enable me to keep the attention of my friends fixed upon myself perhaps to arouse their admiration until the day when i should be well enough to begin to see them again consoled me i told myself this but i was well aware that it was not true that if i chose to imagine their attention as the object of my pleasure that pleasure was an internal spiritual ultimate pleasure which they themselves could not give me and which i might find not in conversing with them but in writing remote from them and that if i began to write in the hope of seeing them indirectly so that they might have a better idea of myself so as to prepare for myself a better position in society perhaps the act of writing would destroy in me any wish to see them and that the position which literature would perhaps give me in society i should no longer feel any wish to enjoy for my pleasure would be no longer in society but in literature

   after luncheon when i went down to mme de guermantes it was less for the sake of mlle dporcheville who had been stripped by saintloups telegram of the better part of her personality than in the hope of finding in the duchess herself one of those readers of my article who would enable me to form an idea of the impression that it had made upon the public  subscribers and purchasers  of the figaro it was not however without pleasure that i went to see mme de guermantes it was all very well my telling myself that what made her house different to me from all the rest was the fact that it had for so long haunted my imagination by knowing the reason for this difference i did not abolish it moreover the name guermantes existed for me in many forms if the form which my memory had merely noted as in an addressbook was not accompanied by any poetry older forms those which dated from the time when i did not know mme de guermantes were liable to renew themselves in me especially when i had not seen her for some time and when the glaring light of the person with human features did not quench the mysterious radiance of the name then once again i began to think of the home of mme de guermantes as of something that was beyond the bounds of reality in the same way as i began to think again of the misty balbec of my early dreams and as though i had not since then made that journey of the one twentytwo train as though i had never taken it i forgot for an instant my own knowledge that such things did not exist as we think at times of a beloved friend forgetting for an instant that he is dead then the idea of reality returned as i set foot in the duchesss hall but i consoled myself with the reflexion that in spite of everything it was for me the actual point of contact between reality and dreams

   when i entered the drawingroom i saw the fair girl whom i had supposed for twentyfour hours to be the girl of whom saintloup had spoken to me it was she who asked the duchess to reintroduce me to her and indeed the moment i came into the room i had the impression that i knew her quite well which the duchess however dispelled by saying oh you have met mlle de forcheville before i myself on the contrary was certain that i had never been introduced to any girl of that name which would certainly have impressed me so familiar was it in my memory ever since i had been given a retrospective account of odettes love affairs and swanns jealousy in itself my twofold error as to the name in having remembered de lorgeville asdporcheville and in having reconstructed as dporcheville what was in reality forcheville was in no way extraordinary our mistake lies in our supposing that things present themselves ordinarily as they are in reality names as they are written people as photography and psychology give an unalterable idea of them as a matter of fact this is not at all what we ordinarily perceive we see we hear we conceive the world quite topsyturvy we repeat a name as we have heard it spoken until experience has corrected our mistake which does not always happen everyone at combray had spoken to franoise for fiveandtwenty years of mme sazerat and franoise continued to say mme sazerin not from that deliberate and proud perseverance in her mistakes which was habitual with her was strengthened by our contradiction and was all that she had added of herself to the france of saintandrdeschamps of the equalitarian principles of 1789 she claimed only one civic right that of not pronouncing words as we did and of maintaining that htel t and air were of the feminine gender but because she really did continue to hear sazerin 

    see swanns way i 53 where however this error is attributed to eulalie c k s m

   this perpetual error which is precisely life does not bestow its thousand forms merely upon the visible and the audible universe but upon the social universe the sentimental universe the historical universe and so forth the princesse de luxembourg is no better than a prostitute in the eyes of the chief magistrates wife which as it happens is of little importance what is slightly more important odette is a difficult woman to swann whereupon he builds up a whole romance which becomes all the more painful when he discovers his error what is more important still the french are thinking only of revenge in the eyes of the germans we have of the universe only formless fragmentary visions which we complete by the association of arbitrary ideas creative of dangerous suggestions i should therefore have had no reason to be surprised when i heard the name forcheville and i was already asking myself whether she was related to the forcheville of whom i had so often heard had not the fair girl said to me at once anxious no doubt to forestall tactfully questions which would have been unpleasant to her you dont remember that you knew me quite well long ago    you used to come to our house    your friend gilberte i could see that you didnt recognise me i recognised you immediately she said this as if she had recognised me immediately in the drawingroom but the truth is that she had recognised me in the street and had greeted me and later mme de guermantes informed me that she had told her as something very odd and extraordinary that i had followed her and brushed against her mistaking her for a prostitute i did not learn until she had left the room why she was called mlle de forcheville after swanns death odette who astonished everyone by her profound prolonged and sincere grief found herself an extremely rich widow forcheville married her after making a long tour of various country houses and ascertaining that his family would acknowledge his wife the family raised certain objections but yielded to the material advantage of not having to provide for the expenses of a needy relative who was about to pass from comparative penury to opulence shortly after this one of swanns uncles upon whose head the successive demise of many relatives had accumulated an enormous fortune died leaving the whole of his fortune to gilberte who thus became one of the wealthiest heiresses in france but this was the moment when from the effects of the dreyfus case there had arisen an antisemitic movement parallel to a more abundant movement towards the penetration of society by israelites the politicians had not been wrong in thinking that the discovery of the judicial error would deal a fatal blow to antisemitism but provisionally at least a social antisemitism was on the contrary enhanced and exacerbated by it forcheville who like every petty nobleman had derived from conversations in the family circle the certainty that his name was more ancient than that of la rochefoucauld considered that in marrying the widow of a jew he had performed the same act of charity as a millionaire who picks up a prostitute in the street and rescues her from poverty and mire he was prepared to extend his bounty to gilberte whose prospects of marriage were assisted by all her millions but were hindered by that absurd name swann he declared that he would adopt her we know that mme de guermantes to the astonishment  which however she liked and was accustomed to provoke  of her friends had after swanns marriage refused to meet his daughter as well as his wife this refusal had been apparently all the more cruel inasmuch as what had long made marriage with odette seem possible to swann was the prospect of introducing his daughter to mme de guermantes and doubtless he ought to have known he who had already had so long an experience of life that these pictures which we form in our mind are never realised for a diversity of reasons among these there is one which meant that he seldom regretted his inability to effect that introduction this reason is that whatever the image may be from the trout to be eaten at sunset which makes a sedentary man decide to take the train to the desire to be able to astonish one evening the proud lady at a cashdesk by stopping outside her door in a magnificent carriage which makes an unscrupulous man decide to commit murder or to long for the death of rich relatives according to whether he is bold or lazy whether he goes ahead in the sequence of his ideas or remains fondling the first link in the chain the act which is destined to enable us to attain to the image whether that act be travel marriage crime    that act modifies us so profoundly that we cease to attach any importance to the reason which made us perform it it may even happen that there never once recurs to his mind the image which the man formed who was not then a traveller or a husband or a criminal or a recluse who has bound himself to work with the idea of fame and has at the same moment rid himself of all desire for fame besides even if we include an obstinate refusal to seem to have desired to act in vain it is probable that the effect of the sunlight would not be repeated that feeling cold at the moment we would long for a bowl of soup by the chimneycorner and not for a trout in the open air that our carriage would leave the cashier unmoved who perhaps for wholly different reasons had a great regard for us and in whom this sudden opulence would arouse suspicion in short we have seen swann when married attach most importance to the relations of his wife and daughter with mme bontemps

   to all the reasons derived from the guermantes way of regarding social life which had made the duchess decide never to allow mme and mlle swann to be introduced to her we may add also that blissful assurance with which people who are not in love hold themselves aloof from what they condemn in lovers and what is explained by their love oh i dont mix myself up in that if it amuses poor swann to do stupid things and ruin his life it is his affair but one never knows with that sort of thing it may end in great trouble i leave them to clear it up for themselves it is the suave mari magno which swann himself recommended to me with regard to the verdurins when he had long ceased to be in love with odette and no longer formed part of the little clan it is everything that makes so wise the judgments of third persons with regard to the passions which they do not feel and the complications of behaviour which those passions involve

   mme de guermantes had indeed applied to the ostracism of mme and mlle swann a perseverance that caused general surprise when mme mole mme de marsantes had begun to make friends with mme swann and to bring a quantity of society ladies to see her mme de guermantes had remained intractable but had made arrangements to blow up the bridges and to see that her cousin the princesse de guermantes followed her example on one of the gravest days of the crisis when during rouviers ministry it was thought that there was going to be war with germany upon going to dine with m de braut at mme de guermantess i found the duchess looking worried i supposed that since she was always dabbling in politics she intended to shew that she was afraid of war as one day when she had appeared at the dinnertable so pensive barely replying in monosyllables upon somebodys inquiring timidly what was the cause of her anxiety she had answered with a grave air i am anxious about china but a moment later mme de guermantes herself volunteering an explanation of that anxious air which i had put down to fear of a declaration of war said to m de braut i am told that marieaynard means to establish the swanns i simply must go and see mariegilbert tomorrow and make her help me to prevent it otherwise there will be no society left the dreyfus case is all very well but then the grocers wife round the corner has only to call herself a nationalist and expect us to invite her to our houses in return and i felt at this speech so frivolous in comparison with the speech that i expected to hear the astonishment of the reader who turning to the usual column of the figarofor the latest news of the russojapanese war finds instead the list of people who have given weddingpresents to mlle de mortemart the importance of an aristocratic marriage having displaced to the end of the paper battles upon land and sea the duchess had come in time moreover to derive from this perseverance pursued beyond all normal limits a satisfaction to her pride which she lost no opportunity of expressing babal she said maintains that we are the two smartest people in paris because he and i are the only two people who do not allow mme and mlle swann to bow to us for he assures me that smartness consists in not knowing mme swann and the duchess ended in a peal of laughter

   however when swann was dead it came to pass that her determination not to know his daughter had ceased to furnish mme de guermantes with all the satisfaction of pride independence selfgovernment persecution which she was capable of deriving from it which had come to an end with the passing of the man who had given her the exquisite sensation that she was resisting him that he was unable to make her revoke her decrees
   then the duchess had proceeded to the promulgation of other decrees which being applied to people who were still alive could make her feel that she was free to act as she might choose she did not speak to the swann girl but when anyone mentioned the girl to her the duchess felt a curiosity as about some place that she had never visited which could no longer be suppressed by her desire to stand out against swanns pretensions besides so many different sentiments may contribute to the formation of a single sentiment that it would be impossible to say whether there was not a lingering trace of affection for swann in this interest no doubt  for in every grade of society a worldly and frivolous life paralyses our sensibility and robs us of the power to resuscitate the dead  the duchess was one of those people who require a personal presence  that presence which like a true guermantes she excelled in protracting  in order to love truly but also and this is less common in order to hate a little so that often her friendly feeling for people suspended during their lifetime by the irritation that some action or other on their part caused her revived after their death she then felt almost a longing to make reparation because she pictured them now  though very vaguely  with only their good qualities and stripped of the petty satisfactions of the petty pretensions which had irritated her in them when they were alive this imparted at times notwithstanding the frivolity of mme de guermantes something that was distinctly noble  blended with much that was base  to her conduct whereas threefourths of the human race flatter the living and pay no attention to the dead she would often do after their death what the people would have longed for her to do whom she had maltreated while they were alive

   as for gilberte all the people who were fond of her and had a certain respect for her dignity could not rejoice at the change in the duchesss attitude towards her except by thinking that gilberte scornfully rejecting advances that came after twentyfive years of insults would be avenging these at length unfortunately moral reflexes are not always identical with what common sense imagines a man who by an untimely insult thinks that he has forfeited for all time all hope of winning the friendship of a person to whom he is attached finds that on the contrary he has established his position gilberte who remained quite indifferent to the people who were kind to her never ceased to think with admiration of the insolent mme de guermantes to ask herself the reasons for such insolence once indeed and this would have made all the people who shewed some affection for her die with shame on her account she had decided to write to the duchess to ask her what she had against a girl who had never done her any injury the guermantes had assumed in her eyes proportions which their birth would have been powerless to give them she placed them not only above all the nobility but even above all the royal houses

   certain women who were old friends of swann took a great interest in gilberte when the aristocracy learned of her latest inheritance they began to remark how well bred she was and what a charming wife she would make people said that a cousin of mme de guermantes the princesse de nivre was thinking of gilberte for her son mme de guermantes hated mme de nivre she announced that such a marriage would be a scandal mme de nivre took fright and swore that she had never thought of it one day after luncheon as the sun was shining and m de guermantes was going to take his wife out mme de guermantes was arranging her hat in front of the mirror her blue eyes gazing into their own reflexion and at her still golden hair her maid holding in her hand various sunshades among which her mistress might choose the sun came flooding in through the window and they had decided to take advantage of the fine weather to pay a call at saintcloud and m de guermantes ready to set off wearing pearlgrey gloves and a tall hat on his head said to himself oriane is really astounding still i find her delicious and went on aloud seeing that his wife seemed to be in a good humour by the way i have a message for you from mme de virelef she wanted to ask you to come on monday to the opera but as shes having the swann girl she did not dare and asked me to explore the ground i dont express any opinion i simply convey the message but really it seems to me that we might     he added evasively for their attitude towards anyone else being a collective attitude and taking an identical form in each of them he knew from his own feelings that his wifes hostility to mlle swann had subsided and that she was anxious to meet her mme de guermantes settled her veil to her liking and chose a sunshade but just as you like what difference do you suppose it can make to me i see no reason against our meeting the girl i simply did not wish that we should appear to be countenancing the dubious establishments of our friends that is all and you were perfectly right replied the duke you are wisdom incarnate madame and you are more ravishing than ever in that hat you are very kind said mme de guermantes with a smile at her husband as she made her way to the door but before entering the carriage she felt it her duty to give him a further explanation there are plenty of people now who call upon the mother besides she has the sense to be ill for nine months of the year    it seems that the child is quite charming everybody knows that we were greatly attached to swann people will think it quite natural and they set off together for saintcloud

   a month later the swann girl who had not yet taken the name of forcheville came to luncheon with the guermantes every conceivable subject was discussed at the end of the meal gilberte said timidly i believe you knew my father quite well why of course we did said mme de guermantes in a melancholy tone which proved that she understood the daughters grief and with a deliberate excess of intensity which gave her the air of concealing the fact that she was not sure whether she did remember the father we knew him quite well i remember him quite well as indeed she might seeing that he had come to see her almost every day for twentyfive years i know quite well who he was let me tell you she went on as though she were seeking to explain to the daughter whom she had had for a father and to give the girl information about him he was a great friend of my motherinlaw and besides he was very intimate with my brotherinlaw palamde he used to come here too indeed he used to come to luncheon here added m de guermantes with an ostentatious modesty and a scrupulous exactitude you remember oriane what a fine man your father was one felt that he must come of a respectable family for that matter i saw once long ago his own father and mother they and he what worthy people

   one felt that if they had parents and son been still alive the duc de guermantes would not have had a moments hesitation in recommending them for a post as gardeners and this is how the faubourg saintgermain speaks to any bourgeois of the other bourgeois whether in order to flatter him with the exception made  during the course of the conversation  in favour of the listener or rather and at the same time in order to humiliate him thus it is that an antisemite in addressing a jew at the very moment when he is smothering him in affability speaks evil of jews in a general fashion which enables him to be wounding without being rude

   but while she could shower compliments upon a person when she met him and could then never bring herself to let him take his leave mme de guermantes was also a slave to this need of personal contact swann might have managed now and then in the excitement of conversation to give the duchess the illusion that she regarded him with a friendly feeling he could do so no longer he was charming said the duchess with a wistful smile and fastening upon gilberte a kindly gaze which would at least supposing the girl to have delicate feelings shew her that she was understood and that mme de guermantes had the two been alone together and had circumstances allowed it would have loved to reveal to her all the depth of her own feelings but m de guermantes whether because he was indeed of the opinion that the circumstances forbade such effusions or because he considered that any exaggeration of sentiment was a matter for women and that men had no more part in it than in the other feminine departments save the kitchen and the winecellar which he had reserved to himself knowing more about them than the duchess felt it incumbent upon him not to encourage by taking part in it this conversation to which he listened with a visible impatience

   moreover mme de guermantes when this outburst of sentiment had subsided added with a worldly frivolity addressing gilberte why he was not only a great friend of my brotherinlaw charlus he was also a great favourite at voisenon the country house of the prince de guermantes as though swanns acquaintance with m de charlus and the prince had been a mere accident as though the duchesss brotherinlaw and cousin were two men with whom swann had happened to be intimate for some special reason whereas swann had been intimate with all the people in that set and as though mme de guermantes were seeking to make gilberte understand who more or less her father had been to place him by one of those character sketches by which when we seek to explain how it is that we happen to know somebody whom we would not naturally know or to give an additional point to our story we name the sponsors by whom a certain person was introduced

   as for gilberte she was all the more glad to find that the subject was dropped in that she herself was anxious only to change it having inherited from swann his exquisite tact combined with an intellectual charm that was appreciated by the duke and duchess who begged her to come again soon moreover with the minute observation of people whose lives have no purpose they would discern one after another in the people with whom they associated the most obvious merits exclaiming their wonder at them with the artless astonishment of a townsman who on going into the country discovers a blade of grass or on the contrary magnifying them as with a microscope making endless comments taking offence at the slightest faults and often applying both processes alternately to the same person in gilbertes case it was first of all upon these minor attractions that the idle perspicacity of m and mme de guermantes was brought to bear did you notice the way in which she pronounced some of her words the duchess said to her husband after the girl had left them it was just like swann i seemed to hear him speaking i was just about to say the very same oriane she is witty she is just like her father i consider that she is even far superior to him think how well she told that story about the seabathing she has a vivacity that swann never had oh but he was after all quite witty i am not saying that he was not witty i say that he lacked vivacity said m de guermantes in a complaining tone for his gout made him irritable and when he had no one else upon whom to vent his irritation it was to the duchess that he displayed it but being incapable of any clear understanding of its causes he preferred to adopt an air of being misunderstood

   this friendly attitude on the part of the duke and duchess meant that for the future they might at the most let fall an occasional your poor father to gilberte which for that matter was quite unnecessary since it was just about this time that forcheville adopted the girl she addressed him as father charmed all the dowagers by her politeness and air of breeding and it was admitted that if forcheville had behaved with the utmost generosity towards her the girl had a good heart and knew how to reward him for his pains doubtless because she was able now and then and desired to shew herself quite at her ease she had reintroduced herself to me and in conversation with me had spoken of her true father but this was an exception and no one now dared utter the name swann in her presence

   i had just caught sight in the drawingroom of two sketches by elstir which formerly had been banished to a little room upstairs in which it was only by chance that i had seen them elstir was now in fashion mme de guermantes could not forgive herself for having given so many of his pictures to her cousin not because they were in fashion but because she now appreciated them fashion is indeed composed of the appreciations of a number of people of whom the guermantes are typical but she could not dream of buying others of his pictures for they had long ago begun to fetch absurdly high prices she was determined to have something at least by elstir in her drawingroom and had brought down these two drawings which she declared she preferred to his paintings

   gilberte recognised the drawings one would say elstir she suggested why yes replied the duchess without thinking it was as a matter of fact your fa    some friends of ours who made us buy them they are admirable to my mind they are superior to his paintings i who had not heard this conversation went closer to the drawings to examine them why this is the elstir that     i saw mme de guermantess signals of despair ah yes the elstir that i admired upstairs it shews far better here than in that passage talking of elstir i mentioned him yesterday in an article in the figaro did you happen to read it you have written an article in the figaro exclaimed m de guermantes with the same violence as if he had exclaimed why she is my cousin yes yesterday in the figaro you are certain that is a great surprise for we each of us get our figaro and if one of us had missed it the other would certainly have noticed it that is so aint it oriane there was nothing in the paper the duke sent for the figaro and accepted the facts as though previously the probability had been that i had made a mistake as to the newspaper for which i had written whats that i dont understand do you mean to say you have written an article in thefigaro said the duchess making an effort in order to speak of a matter which did not interest her come basin you can read it afterwards no the duke looks so nice like that with his big beard sweeping over the paper said gilberte i shall read it as soon as i am at home yes he wears a beard now that everybody is cleanshaven said the duchess he never does anything like other people when we were first married he shaved not only his beard but his moustaches as well the peasants who didnt know him by sight thought that he couldnt be french he was called at that time the prince des laumes is there still a prince des laumes asked gilberte who was interested in everything that concerned the people who had refused to bow to her during all those years why no the duchess replied with a melancholy caressing gaze such a charming title one of the finest titles in france said gilberte a certain sort of banality emerging inevitably as a clock strikes the hour from the lips of certain quite intelligent persons yes indeed i regret it too basin would have liked his sisters  son to take it but it is not the same thing after all it is possible since it is not necessarily the eldest son the title may pass to a younger brother i was telling you that in those days basin was cleanshaven one day at a pilgrimage  you remember my dear she turned to her husband that pilgrimage at paraylemonial  my brotherinlaw charlus who always enjoys talking to peasants was saying to one after another where do you come from and as he is extremely generous he would give them something take them off to have a drink for nobody was ever at the same time simpler and more haughty than mme youll see him refuse to bow to a duchess whom he doesnt think duchessy enough and shower compliments upon a kennelman and so i said to basin come basin say something to them too my husband who is not always very inventive  thank you oriane said the duke without interrupting his reading of my article in which he was immersed approached one of the peasants and repeated his brothers question in so many words where do you come from i am from les laumes you are from les laumes why i am your prince then the peasant looked at basins smooth face and replied s not true youre an english  one saw thus in these anecdotes told by the duchess those great and eminent titles such as that of the prince des laumes rise to their true position in their original state and their local colour as in certain books of hours one sees amid the mob of the period the soaring steeple of bourges

    translators footnote mme de guermantes forgets that she has already told this story at the expense of the prince de lon see the captive p 403

   some cards were brought to her which a footman had just left at the door i cant think what has come over her i dont know her it is to you that i am indebted for this basin not that they have done you any good all these people my poor dear and turning to gilberte i really dont know how to explain to you who she is you certainly have never heard of her she calls herself lady rufus israel
   gilberte flushed crimson i do not know her she said which was all the more untrue in that lady israel and swann had been reconciled two years before the latters death and she addressed gilberte by her christian name but i know quite well from hearing about her who it is that you mean the truth is that gilberte had become a great snob for instance another girl having one day whether in malice or from a natural want of tact asked her what was the name of her real  not her adoptive  father in her confusion and as though to mitigate the crudity of what she had to say instead of pronouncing the name as souann she said svann a change as she soon realised for the worse since it made this name of english origin a german patronymic and she had even gone on to say abasing herself so as to rise higher all sorts of stories have been told about my birth but of course i know nothing about that

   ashamed as gilberte must have felt at certain moments when she thought of her parents for even mme swann represented to her and was a good mother of such an attitude towards life we must alas bear in mind that its elements were borrowed doubtless from her parents for we do not create the whole of our own personality but with a certain quantity of egoism which exists in the mother a different egoism inherent in the fathers family is combined which does not invariably mean that it is added nor even precisely that it serves as a multiple but rather that it creates a fresh egoism infinitely stronger and more redoubtable and in the period that has elapsed since the world began during which families in which some defect exists in one form have been intermarrying with families in which the same defect exists in another thereby creating a peculiarly complex and detestable variety of that defect in the offspring the accumulated egoisms to confine ourselves for the moment to this defect would have acquired such force that the whole human race would have been destroyed did not the malady itself bring forth with the power to reduce it to its true dimensions natural restrictions analogous to those which prevent the infinite proliferation of the infusoria from destroying our planet the unisexual fertilisation of plants from bringing about the extinction of the vegetable kingdom and so forth from time to time a virtue combines with this egoism to produce a new and disinterested force

   the combinations by which in the course of generations moral chemistry thus stabilises and renders inoffensive the elements that were becoming too formidable are infinite and would give an exciting variety to family history moreover with these accumulated egoisms such as must have been embodied in gilberte there coexists some charming virtue of the parents it appears for a moment to perform an interlude by itself to play its touching part with an entire sincerity

   no doubt gilberte did not always go so far as when she insinuated that she was perhaps the natural daughter of some great personage but as a rule she concealed her origin perhaps it was simply too painful for her to confess it and she preferred that people should learn of it from others perhaps she really believed that she was hiding it with that uncertain belief which at the same time is not doubt which reserves a possibility for what we would like to think true of which musset furnishes an example when he speaks of hope in god i do not know her personally gilberte went on had she after all when she called herself mlle de forcheville a hope that people would not know that she was swanns daughter some people perhaps who she hoped would in time become everybody she could not be under any illusion as to their number at the moment and knew doubtless that many people must be murmuring isnt that swanns daughter but she knew it only with that information which tells us of people taking their lives in desperation while we are going to a ball that is to say a remote and vague information for which we are at no pains to substitute a more precise knowledge founded upon a direct impression gilberte belonged during these years at least to the most widespread variety of the human ostrich the kind which buries its head in the hope not of not being seen which it considers hardly probable but of not seeing that other people see it which seems to it something to the good and enables it to leave the rest to chance as distance makes things smaller more uncertain less dangerous gilberte preferred not to be near other people at the moment when they made the discovery that she was by birth a swann

   and as we are near the people whom we picture to ourselves as we can picture people reading their newspaper gilberte preferred the papers to style her mlle de forcheville it is true that with the writings for which she herself was responsible her letters she prolonged the transition for some time by signing herself g s forcheville the real hypocrisy in this signature was made manifest by the suppression not so much of the other letters of the word swann as of those of the word gilberte in fact by reducing the innocent christian name to a simple g mlle de forcheville seemed to insinuate to her friends that the similar amputation applied to the name swann was due merely to the necessity of abbreviation indeed she gave a special importance to the s and gave it a sort of long tail which ran across the g but which one felt to be transitory and destined to disappear like the tail which still long in the monkey has ceased to exist in man

   notwithstanding this in her snobbishness there remained the intelligent curiosity of swann i remember that during this same afternoon she asked mme de guermantes whether she could meet m du lau and that when the duchess replied that he was an invalid and never went out gilberte asked what sort of man he was for she added with a faint blush she had heard a great deal about him the marquis du lau had indeed been one of swanns most intimate friends before the latters marriage and gilberte may perhaps herself have seen him but at a time when she was not interested in such people would m de braut or the prince dagrigente be at all like him she asked oh not in the least exclaimed mme de guermantes who had a keen sense of these provincial differences and drew portraits that were sober but coloured by her harsh golden voice beneath the gentle blossoming of her violet eyes no not in the least du lau was the gentleman from the prigord charming with all the good manners and the absence of ceremony of his province at guermantes when we had the king of england with whom du lau was on the friendliest terms we used to have a little meal after the men came in from shooting    it was the hour when du lau was in the habit of going to his room to take off his boots and put on big woollen slippers very well the presence of king edward and all the grand dukes did not disturb him in the least he came down to the great hall at guermantes in his woollen slippers he felt that he was the marquis du lau dollemans who had no reason to put himself out for the king of england he and that charming quasimodo de breteuil they were the two that i liked best they were for that matter great friends of     she was about to say your father and stopped short no there is no resemblance at all either to grigri or to braut he was the genuine nobleman from the prigord for that matter mme quotes a page from saintsimon about a marquis dollemans it is just like him i repeated the opening words of the portrait m dollemans who was a man of great distinction among the nobility of the prigord from his own birth and from his merit and was regarded by every soul alive there as a general arbiter to whom each had recourse because of his probity his capacity and the suavity of his manners as it were the cock of his province yes hes like that said mme de guermantes all the more so as du lau was always as red as a cock yes i remember hearing that description quoted said gilberte without adding that it had been quoted by her father who was as we know a great admirer of saintsimon

   she liked also to speak of the prince dagrigente and of m de braut for another reason the prince dagrigente was prince by inheritance from the house of aragon but his lordship was poitevin as for his country house the house that is to say in which he lived it was not the property of his own family but had come to him from his mothers former husband and was situated almost halfway between martinville and guermantes and so gilberte spoke of him and of m de braut as of neighbours in the country who reminded her of her old home strictly speaking there was an element of falsehood in this attitude since it was only in paris through the comtesse mol that she had come to know m de braut albeit he had been an old friend of her father as for her pleasure in speaking of the country round tansonville it may have been sincere snobbishness is with certain people analogous to those pleasant beverages with which they mix nutritious substances gilberte took an interest in some lady of fashion because she possessed priceless books and portraits by nattier which my former friend would probably not have taken the trouble to inspect in the national library or at the louvre and i imagine that notwithstanding the even greater proximity the magnetic influence of tansonville would have had less effect in drawing gilberte towards mme sazerat or mme goupil than towards m dagrigente

    oh poor babal and poor grigri said mme de guermantes they are in a far worse state than du lau im afraid they havent long to live either of them

   when m de guermantes had finished reading my article he paid me compliments which however he took care to qualify he regretted the slightly hackneyed form of a style in which there were emphasis metaphors as in the antiquated prose of chateaubriand on the other hand he congratulated me without reserve upon my occupying myself i like a man to do something with his ten fingers i do not like the useless creatures who are always selfimportant or agitators a fatuous breed

   gilberte who was acquiring with extreme rapidity the ways of the world of fashion announced how proud she would be to say that she was the friend of an author you can imagine that i shall tell people that i have the pleasure the honour of your acquaintance

    you wouldnt care to come with us tomorrow to the opracomique the duchess asked me and i thought that it would be doubtless in that same box in which i had first beheld her and which had seemed to me then as inaccessible as the submarine realm of the nereids but i replied in a melancholy tone no i am not going to the theatre just now i have lost a friend to whom i was greatly attached the tears almost came to my eyes as i said this and yet for the first time i felt a sort of pleasure in speaking of my bereavement it was from this moment that i began to write to all my friends that i had just experienced great sorrow and to cease to feel it

   when gilberte had gone mme de guermantes said to me you did not understand my signals i was trying to hint to you not to mention swann and as i apologised but i quite understand i was on the point of mentioning him myself i stopped short just in time it was terrible fortunately i bridled my tongue you know it is a great bore she said to her husband seeking to mitigate my own error by appearing to believe that i had yielded to a propensity common to everyone and difficult to resist what do you expect me to do replied the duke you have only to tell them to take those drawings upstairs again since they make you think about swann if you dont think about swann you wont speak about him

   on the following day i received two congratulatory letters which surprised me greatly one from mme goupil whom i had not seen for many years and to whom even at combray i had not spoken more than twice a public library had given her the chance of seeing the figaro thus when anything occurs in our life which makes some stir messages come to us from people situated so far outside the zone of our acquaintance our memory of whom is already so remote that these people seem to be placed at a great distance especially in the dimension of depth a forgotten friendship of our school days which has had a score of opportunities of recalling itself to our mind gives us a sign of life not that there are not negative results also for example bloch from whom i would have been so glad to learn what he thought of my article did not write to me it is true that he had read the article and was to admit it later but by a counterstroke in fact he himself contributed some years later an article to the figaro and was anxious to inform me immediately of the event as he ceased to be jealous of what he regarded as a privilege as soon as it had fallen to him as well the envy that had made him pretend to ignore my article ceased as though by the raising of a lever he mentioned it to me but not at all in the way in which he hoped to hear me mention his article i know that you too he told me have written an article but i did not think that i ought to mention it to you for fear of hurting your feelings for we ought not to speak to our friends of the humiliations that occur to them and it is obviously a humiliation to supply the organ of sabres and aspergills with fiveoclocks not forgetting the holywaterstoup his character remained unaltered but his style had become less precious as happens to certain people who shed their mannerisms when ceasing to compose symbolist poetry they take to writing newspaper serials

   to console myself for his silence i read mme goupils letter again but it was lacking in warmth for if the aristocracy employ certain formulas which slip into watertight compartments between the initial monsieur and the sentiments distingus of the close cries of joy of admiration may spring up like flowers and their clusters waft over the barriers their entrancing fragrance but middleclass conventionality enwraps even the content of letters in a net of your welldeserved success at best your great success sistersinlaw faithful to their upbringing and tightlaced in their respectable stays think that they have overflowed into the most distressing enthusiasm if they have written my kindest regards mother joins me is a superlative of which they are seldom wearied

   i received another letter as well as mme goupils but the name of the writer was unknown to me it was an illiterate hand a charming style i was desolate at my inability to discover who had written to me

   while i was asking myself whether bergotte would have liked this article mme de forcheville had replied that he would have admired it enormously and could not have read it without envy but she had told me this while i slept it was a dream

   almost all our dreams respond thus to the questions which we put to ourselves with complicated statements presentations of several characters on the stage which however lead to nothing

   as for mlle de forcheville i could not help feeling appalled when i thought of her what the daughter of swann who would so have loved to see her at the guermantes for whom they had refused their great friend the favour of an invitation they had now sought out of their own accord time having elapsed which refashions everything for us instils a fresh personality based upon what we have been told about them into people whom we have not seen during a long interval in which we ourselves have grown a new skin and acquired fresh tastes i recalled how to this girl swann used to say at times as he hugged her and kissed her it is a comfort my darling to have a child like you one day when i am no longer here if people still mention your poor papa it will be only to you and because of you swann in anticipating thus after his own death a timorous and anxious hope of his survival in his daughter was as greatly mistaken as the old banker who having made a will in favour of a little dancer whom he is keeping and who behaves admirably tells himself that he is nothing more to her than a great friend but that she will remain faithful to his memory she did behave admirably while her feet under the table sought the feet of those of the old bankers friends who appealed to her but all this was concealed beneath an excellent exterior she will wear mourning for the worthy man will feel that she is well rid of him will enjoy not only the ready money but the real estate the motorcars that he has bequeathed to her taking care to remove the monogram of the former owner which makes her feel slightly ashamed and with her enjoyment of the gift will never associate any regret for the giver the illusions of paternal affection are perhaps no less deceiving than those of the other kind many girls regard their fathers only as the old men who are going to leave them a fortune gilbertes presence in a drawingroom instead of being an opportunity for speaking occasionally still of her father was an obstacle in the way of peoples seizing those opportunities increasingly more rare that they might still have had of referring to him even in connexion with the things that he had said the presents that he had made people acquired the habit of not mentioning him and she who ought to have refreshed not to say perpetuated his memory found herself hastening and completing the process of death and oblivion

   and it was not merely with regard to swann that gilberte was gradually completing the process of oblivion she had accelerated in me that process of oblivion with regard to albertine

   under the action of desire and consequently of the desire for happiness which gilberte had aroused in me during those hours in which i had supposed her to be some one else a certain number of miseries of painful preoccupations which only a little while earlier had obsessed my mind had been released carrying with them a whole block of memories probably long since crumbled and become precarious with regard to albertine for if many memories which were connected with her had at the outset helped to keep alive in me my regret for her death in return that regret had itself fixed those memories so that the modification of my sentimental state prepared no doubt obscurely day by day by the constant disintegration of oblivion but realised abruptly as a whole gave me the impression which i remember that i felt that day for the first time of a void of the suppression in myself of a whole portion of my association of ideas which a man feels in whose brain an artery long exhausted has burst so that a whole section of his memory is abolished or paralysed

   the vanishing of my suffering and of all that it carried away with it left me diminished as does often the healing of a malady which occupied a large place in our life no doubt it is because memories are not always genuine that love is not eternal and because life is made up of a perpetual renewal of our cells but this renewal in the case of memories is nevertheless retarded by the attention which arrests and fixes a moment that is bound to change and since it is the case with grief as with the desire for women that we increase it by thinking about it the fact of having plenty of other things to do should like chastity make oblivion easy

   by another reaction albeit it was the distraction  the desire for mlle dporcheville  that had made my oblivion suddenly apparent and perceptible if the fact remains that it is time that gradually brings oblivion oblivion does not fail to alter profoundly our notion of time there are optical errors in time as there are in space the persistence in myself of an old tendency to work to make up for lost time to change my way of life or rather to begin to live gave me the illusion that i was still as young as in the past and yet the memory of all the events that had followed one another in my life and also of those that had followed one another in my heart for when we have greatly changed we are led to suppose that our life has been longer in the course of those last months of albertines existence had made them seem to me much longer than a year and now this oblivion of so many things separating me by gulfs of empty space from quite recent events which they made me think remote because i had had what is called the time to forget them by its fragmentary irregular interpolation in my memory  like a thick fog at sea which obliterates all the landmarks  confused destroyed my sense of distances in time contracted in one place extended in another and made me suppose myself now farther away from things now far closer to them than i really was and as in the fresh spaces as yet unexplored which extended before me there would be no more trace of my love for albertine than there had been in the time past which i had just traversed of my love for my grandmother my life appeared to me  offering a succession of periods in which after a certain interval nothing of what had sustained the previous period survived in that which followed  as something so devoid of the support of an individual identical and permanent self something so useless in the future and so protracted in the past that death might just as well put an end to its course here or there without in the least concluding it as with those courses of french history which in the rhetoric class stop short indifferently according to the whim of the curriculum or the professor at the revolution of 1830 or at that of 1848 or at the end of the second empire

   perhaps then the fatigue and distress which i was feeling were due not so much to my having loved in vain what i was already beginning to forget as to my coming to take pleasure in the company of fresh living people purely social figures mere friends of the guermantes offering no interest in themselves it was easier perhaps to reconcile myself to the discovery that she whom i had loved was nothing more after a certain interval of time than a pale memory than to the rediscovery in myself of that futile activity which makes us waste time in decorating our life with a human vegetation that is alive but is parasitic which likewise will become nothing when it is dead which already is alien to all that we have ever known which nevertheless our garrulous melancholy conceited senility seeks to attract the newcomer who would find it easy to endure the prospect of life without albertine had made his appearance in me since i had been able to speak of her at mme de guermantess in the language of grief without any real suffering these strange selves which were to bear each a different name the possibility of their coming had by reason of their indifference to the object of my love always alarmed me long ago in connexion with gilberte when her father told me that if i went to live in oceania i would never wish to return quite recently when i had read with such a pang in my heart the passage in bergottes novel where he treats of the character who separated by the events of life from a woman whom he had adored when he was young as an old man meets her without pleasure without any desire to see her again now on the contrary he was bringing me with oblivion an almost complete elimination of suffering a possibility of comfort this person so dreaded so beneficent who was none other than one of those spare selves whom destiny holds in reserve for us and without paying any more heed to our entreaties than a clearsighted and so all the more authoritative physician substitutes without our aid by an opportune intervention for the self that has been too seriously injured this renewal as it happens nature performs from time to time as by the decay and refashioning of our tissues but we notice this only if the former self contained a great grief a painful foreign body which we are surprised to find no longer there in our amazement at having become another self to whom the sufferings of his precursor are nothing more than the sufferings of a stranger of which we can speak with compassion because we do not feel them indeed we are unaffected by our having undergone all those sufferings since we have only a vague remembrance of having suffered them it is possible that similarly our dreams during the night may be terrible but when we awake we are another person to whom it is of no importance that the person whose place he takes has had to fly during our sleep from a band of cutthroats

   no doubt this self had maintained some contact with the old self as a friend unconcerned by a bereavement speaks of it nevertheless to those who come to the house in a suitable tone of sorrow and returns from time to time to the room in which the widower who has asked him to receive the company for him may still be heard weeping i made this contact even closer when i became once again for a moment the former friend of albertine but it was into a new personality that i was tending to pass altogether it is not because other people are dead that our affection for them grows faint it is because we ourselves are dying albertine had no cause to rebuke her friend the man who was usurping his name had merely inherited it we may be faithful to what we remember we remember only what we have known my new self while it grew up in the shadow of the old had often heard the other speak of albertine through that other self through the information that it gathered from it it thought that it knew her it found her attractive it was in love with her but this was merely an affection at second hand

   another person in whom the process of oblivion so far as concerned albertine was probably more rapid at this time and enabled me in return to realise a little later a fresh advance which that process had made in myself and this is my memory of a second stage before the final oblivion was andre i can scarcely indeed refrain from citing this oblivion of albertine as if not the sole cause if not even the principal cause at any rate a conditioning and necessary cause of a conversation between andre and myself about six months after the conversation which i have already reported when her words were so different from those that she had used on the former occasion i remember that it was in my room because at that moment i found a pleasure in having semicarnal relations with her because of the collective form originally assumed and now being resumed by my love for the girls of the little band a love that had long been undivided among them and for a while associated exclusively with albertines person during the months that had preceded and followed her death

   we were in my room for another reason as well which enables me to date this conversation quite accurately this was that i had been banished from the rest of the apartment because it was mammas day notwithstanding its being her day and after some hesitation mamma had gone to luncheon with mme sazerat thinking that as mme sazerat always contrived to invite one to meet boring people she would be able without sacrificing any pleasure to return home in good time and she had indeed returned in time and without regret mme sazerat having had nobody but the most deadly people who were frozen from the start by the special voice that she adopted when she had company what mamma called her wednesday voice my mother was nevertheless extremely fond of her was sorry for her poverty  the result of the extravagance of her father who had been ruined by the duchesse de x    a poverty which compelled her to live all the year round at combray with a few weeks at her cousins house in paris and a great pleasuretrip every ten years

   i remember that the day before this at my request repeated for months past and because the princess was always begging her to come mamma had gone to call upon the princesse de parme who herself paid no calls and at whose house people as a rule contented themselves with writing their names but who had insisted upon my mothers coming to see her since the rules and regulations prevented her from coming to us my mother had come home thoroughly cross you have sent me on a fools errand she told me the princesse de parme barely greeted me she turned back to the ladies to whom she was talking without paying me any attention and after ten minutes as she hadnt uttered a word to me i came away without her even offering me her hand i was extremely annoyed however on the doorstep as i was leaving i met the duchesse de guermantes who was very kind and spoke to me a great deal about you what a strange idea that was to tell her about albertine she told me that you had said to her that her death had been such a grief to you i shall never go near the princesse de parme again you have made me make a fool of myself

   well the next day which was my mothers athome day as i have said andre came to see me she had not much time for she had to go and call for gisle with whom she was very anxious to dine i know her faults but she is after all my best friend and the person for whom i feel most affection she told me and she even appeared to feel some alarm at the thought that i might ask her to let me dine with them she was hungry for people and a third person who knew her too well such as myself would by preventing her from letting herself go at once prevent her from enjoying complete satisfaction in their company

   the memory of albertine had become so fragmentary in me that it no longer caused me any sorrow and was no more now than a transition to fresh desires like a chord which announces a change of key and indeed the idea of a momentary sensual caprice being ruled out in so far as i was still faithful to albertines memory i was happier at having andre in my company than i would have been at having an albertine miraculously restored to life for andre could tell me more things about albertine than albertine herself had ever told me now the problems concerning albertine still remained in my mind when my affection for her both physical and moral had already vanished and my desire to know about her life because it had diminished less was now relatively greater than my need of her presence on the other hand the thought that a woman had perhaps had relations with albertine no longer provoked in me anything save the ooodesire to have relations myself also with that woman i told andre this caressing her as i spoke then without making the slightest effort to harmonise her speech with what she had said a few months earlier andre said to me with a lurking smile ah yes but you are a man and so we cant do quite the same things as i used to do with albertine and whether it was that she considered that this increased my desire in the hope of extracting confidences i had told her that i would like to have relations with a woman who had had them with albertine or my grief or perhaps destroyed a sense of superiority to herself which she might suppose me to feel at being the only person who had had relations with albertine ah we spent many happy hours together she was so caressing so passionate besides it was not only with me that she liked to enjoy herself she had met a nice boy at mme verdurins morel they understood each other at once he undertook with her permission to enjoy himself with them too for he liked virgins to procure little girls for her as soon as he had set their feet on the path he left them and so he made himself responsible for attracting young fishergirls in some quiet wateringplace young laundresses who would fall in love with a boy but would not have listened to a girls advances as soon as the girl was well under his control he would bring her to a safe place where he handed her over to albertine for fear of losing morel who took part in it all too the girl always obeyed and yet she lost him all the same for as he was afraid of what might happen and also as once or twice was enough for him he would slip away leaving a false address once he had the nerve to bring one of these girls with albertine to a brothel at corliville where four or five of the women had her at once or in turn that was his passion and albertines also but albertine suffered terrible remorse afterwards i believe that when she was with you she had conquered her passion and put off indulging it from day to day then her affection for yourself was so strong that she felt scruples but it was quite certain that if she ever left you she would begin again she hoped that you would rescue her that you would marry her she felt in her heart that it was a sort of criminal lunacy and i have often asked myself whether it was not after an incident of that sort which had led to a suicide in a family that she killed herself on purpose i must confess that in the early days of her life with you she had not entirely given up her games with me there were days when she seemed to need it so much so that once when it would have been so easy elsewhere she could not say goodbye without taking me to bed with her in your house we had no luck we were very nearly caught she had taken her opportunity when franoise had gone out on some errand and you had not come home then she had turned out all the lights so that when you let yourself in with your key it would take you some time to find the switch and she had not shut the door of her room we heard you come upstairs i had just time to make myself tidy and begin to come down which was quite unnecessary for by an incredible accident you had left your key at home and had to ring the bell but we lost our heads all the same so that to conceal our awkwardness we both of us without any opportunity of discussing it had the same idea to pretend to be afraid of the scent of syringa which as a matter of fact we adored you were bringing a long branch of it home with you which enabled me to turn my head away and hide my confusion this did not prevent me from telling you in the most idiotic way that perhaps franoise had come back and would let you in when a moment earlier i had told you the lie that we had only just come in from our drive and that when we arrived franoise had not left the house and was just going on an errand but our mistake was  supposing you to have your key  turning out the light for we were afraid that as you came upstairs you would see it turned on again or at least we hesitated too long and for three nights on end albertine could not close an eye for she was always afraid that you might be suspicious and ask franoise why she had not turned on the light before leaving the house for albertine was terribly afraid of you and at times she would assure me that you were wicked mean that you hated her really after three days she gathered from your calm that you had said nothing to franoise and she was able to sleep again but she never did anything with me after that perhaps from fear perhaps from remorse for she made out that she did really love you or perhaps she was in love with some other man in any case nobody could ever mention syringa again in her hearing without her turning crimson and putting her hand over her face in the hope of hiding her blushes

   as there are strokes of good fortune so there are misfortunes that come too late they do not assume all the importance that they would have had in our eyes a little earlier among these was the calamity that andres terrible revelation was to me no doubt even when bad tidings ought to make us unhappy it so happens that in the diversion the balanced give and take of conversation they pass by us without stopping and that we ourselves preoccupied with a thousand things which we have to say in response transformed by the desire to please our present company into some one else protected for a few moments in this new environment against the affections the sufferings that he has discarded upon entering it and will find again when the brief spell is broken have not the time to take them in and yet if those affections those sufferings are too predominant we enter only distractedly into the zone of a new and momentary world in which too faithful to our sufferings we are incapable of becoming another person and then the words that we hear said enter at once into relation with our heart which has not remained out of action but for some time past words that concerned albertine had like a poison that has evaporated lost their toxic power she was already too remote from me

   as a wayfarer seeing in the afternoon a misty crescent in the sky says to himself that is it the vast moon so i said to myself what so that truth which i have sought so earnestly which i have so dreaded is nothing more than these few words uttered in the course of conversation words to which we cannot even give our whole attention since we are not alone besides it took me at a serious disadvantage i had exhausted myself with andre with a truth of such magnitude i would have liked to have more strength to devote to it it remained outside me but this was because i had not yet found a place for it in my heart we would like the truth to be revealed to us by novel signs not by a phrase similar to those which we have constantly repeated to ourselves the habit of thinking prevents us at times from feeling reality makes us immune to it makes it seem no more than another thought

   there is no idea that does not carry in itself a possible refutation no word that does not imply its opposite in any case if all this was true how futile a verification of the life of a mistress who exists no longer rising up from the depths and coming to the surface just when we are no longer able to make any use of it then thinking doubtless of some other woman whom we now love and with regard to whom the same change may occur for to her whom we have forgotten we no longer give a thought we lose heart we say to ourselves if she were alive we say to ourselves if she who is alive could understand all this and that when she is dead i shall know everything that she is hiding from me but this is a vicious circle if i could have brought albertine back to life the immediate consequence would have been that andre would have revealed nothing it is the same thing as the everlasting youll see what its like when i no longer love you which is so true and so absurd since as a matter of fact we should elicit much if we were no longer in love but when we should no longer think of inquiring it is precisely the same for the woman whom we see again when we are no longer in love with her if she tells us everything the fact is that she is no longer herself or that we are no longer ourselves the person who was in love has ceased to exist there also death has passed by and has made everything easy and unnecessary i pursued these reflexions adopting the hypothesis that andre had been telling the truth  which was possible  and had been prompted to sincerity with me precisely because she now had relations with me by that saintandrdeschamps side of her nature which albertine too had shewn me at the start she was encouraged in this case by the fact that she was no longer afraid of albertine for other peoples reality survives their death for only a short time in our mind and after a few years they are like those gods of obsolete religions whom we insult without fear because people have ceased to believe in their existence but the fact that andre no longer believed in the reality of albertine might mean that she no longer feared any more than to betray a secret which she had promised not to reveal to invent a falsehood which slandered retrospectively her alleged accomplice had this absence of fear permitted her to reveal at length in speaking as she did the truth or rather to invent a falsehood if for some reason she supposed me to be full of happiness and pride and wished to pain me perhaps the sight of me caused her a certain irritation held in suspense so long as she saw that i was miserable unconsoled because i had had relations with albertine and she envied me perhaps  supposing that i considered myself on that account more highly favoured than her  an advantage which she herself had never perhaps obtained nor even sought thus it was that i had often heard her say how ill they were looking to people whose air of radiant health and what was more their consciousness of their own air of radiant health exasperated her and say in the hope of annoying them that she herself was very well a fact that she did not cease to proclaim when she was seriously ill until the day when in the detachment of death it no longer mattered to her that other fortunate people should be well and should know that she was dying but this day was still remote perhaps she had turned against me for what reason i knew not in one of whose rages in which she used long ago to turn against the young man so learned in sporting matters so ignorant of everything else whom we had met at balbec who since then had been living with rachel and at the mention of whom andre overflowed in defamatory speeches hoping to be sued for libel in order to be able to launch against his father disgraceful accusations the falsehood of which he would not be able to prove quite possibly this rage against myself had simply revived having doubtless ceased when she saw how miserable i was indeed the very same people whom she her eyes flashing with rage had longed to disgrace to kill to send to prison by false testimony if need be she had only to know that they were unhappy crushed to cease to wish them any harm and to be ready to overwhelm them with kindnesses for she was not fundamentally wicked and if her nonapparent somewhat buried nature was not the kindness which one divined at first from her delicate attentions but rather envy and pride her third nature buried more deeply still the true but not entirely realised nature tended towards goodness and the love of her neighbour only like all those people who being in a certain state of life desire a better state but knowing it only by desire do not realise that the first condition is to break away from the former state  like the neurasthenics or morphinomaniacs who are anxious to be cured but at the same time do not wish to be deprived of their manias or their morphine like the religious hearts or artistic spirits attached to the world who long for solitude but seek nevertheless to imagine it as not implying an absolute renunciation of their former existence  andre was prepared to love all her fellowcreatures but on the condition that she should first of all have succeeded in not imagining them as triumphant and to that end should have humiliated them in advance she did not understand that we ought to love even the proud and to conquer their pride by love and not by a more overweening pride but the fact is that she was like those invalids who wish to be cured by the very means that prolong their malady which they like and would cease at once to like if they renounced them but people wish to learn to swim and at the same time to keep one foot on the ground as for the young sportsman the verdurins nephew whom i had met during my two visits to balbec i am bound to add as an accessory statement and in anticipation that some time after andres visit a visit my account of which will be resumed in a moment certain events occurred which caused a great sensation first of all this young man perhaps remembering albertine with whom i did not then know that he had been in love became engaged to andre and married her notwithstanding the despair of rachel to which he paid not the slightest attention andre no longer said then that is to say some months after the visit of which i have been speaking that he was a wretch and i realised later on that she had said so only because she was madly in love with him and thought that he did not want to have anything to do with her but another fact impressed me even more this young man produced certain sketches for the theatre with settings and costumes designed by himself which have effected in the art of today a revolution at least equal to that brought about by the russian ballet in fact the best qualified critics regarded his work as something of capital importance almost as works of genius and for that matter i agree with them confirming thus to my own astonishment the opinion long held by rachel the people who had known him at balbec anxious only to be certain whether the cut of the clothes of the men with whom he associated was or was not smart who had seen him spend all his time at baccarat at the races on the golf course or on the polo ground who knew that at school he had always been a dunce and had even been expelled from the lyce to annoy his parents he had spent two months in the smart brothel in which m de charlus had hoped to surprise morel thought that perhaps his work was done by andre who in her love for him chose to leave him the renown or that more probably he was paying out of his huge private fortune at which his excesses had barely nibbled some inspired but needy professional to create it people in this kind of wealthy society not purified by mingling with the aristocracy and having no idea of what constitutes an artist  a word which to them is represented only by an actor whom they engage to recite monologues at the party given for their daughters betrothal at once handing him his fee discreetly in another room or by a painter to whom they make her sit after she is married before the children come and when she is still at her best  are apt to believe that all the people in society who write compose or paint have their work done for them and pay to obtain a reputation as an author as other men pay to make sure of a seat in parliament but all this was false and the young man was indeed the author of those admirable works when i learned this i was obliged to hesitate between contrary suppositions either he had indeed been for years on end the coarse brute that he appeared to be and some physiological cataclysm had awakened in him the dormant genius like a sleeping beauty or else at the period of his tempestuous schooldays of his failures to matriculate in the final examination of his heavy gambling losses at balbec of his reluctance to shew himself in the tram with his aunt verdurins faithful because of their unconventional attire he was already a man of genius distracted perhaps from his genius having left its key beneath the doormat in the effervescence of juvenile passions or again already a conscious man of genius and at the bottom of his classes because while the master was uttering platitudes about cicero he himself was reading rimbaud or goethe certainly there was no ground for any such hypothesis when i met him at balbec where his interests seemed to me to be centred solely in turning out a smart carriage and pair and in mixing cocktails but even this is not an insuperable objection he might be extremely vain and this may be allied to genius and might seek to shine in the manner which he knew to be dazzling in the world in which he lived which did not mean furnishing a profound knowledge of elective affinities but far rather a knowledge of how to drive fourinhand moreover i am not at all sure that later on when he had become the author of those fine and so original works he would have cared greatly outside the theatres in which he was known to greet anyone who was not in evening dress like the faithful in their earlier manner which would be a proof in him not of stupidity but of vanity and indeed of a certain practical sense a certain clairvoyance in adapting his vanity to the mentality of the imbeciles upon whose esteem he depended and in whose eyes a dinnerjacket might perhaps shine with a more brilliant radiance than the eyes of a thinker who can say whether seen from without some man of talent or even a man devoid of talent but a lover of the things of the mind myself for instance would not have appeared to anyone who met him at rivebelle at the hotel at balbec or on the beach there the most perfect and pretentious imbecile not to mention that for octave matters of art must have been a thing so intimate a thing that lived so in the most secret places of his heart that doubtless it would never have occurred to him to speak of them as saintloup for instance would have spoken for whom the fine arts had the importance that horses and carriages had for octave besides he may have had a passion for gambling and it is said that he has retained it all the same even if the piety which brought to light the unknown work of vinteuil arose from amid the troubled life of montjouvain i was no less impressed by the thought that the masterpieces which are perhaps the most extraordinary of our day have emerged not from the university certificate from a model academic education upon broglie lines but from the frquentation of paddocks and fashionable bars in any case in those days at balbec the reasons which made me anxious to know him which made albertine and her friends anxious that i should not know him were equally detached from his merit and could only have brought into prominence the eternal misunderstanding between an intellectual represented in this instance by myself and people in society represented by the little band with regard to a person in society the young golfer i had no inkling of his talent and his prestige in my eyes like that in the past of mme blatin had been that of his being  whatever they might say  the friend of my girl friends and more one of their band than myself on the other hand albertine and andre symbolising in this respect the incapacity of people in society to bring a sound judgment to bear upon the things of the mind and their propensity to attach themselves in that connexion to false appearances not only thought me almost idiotic because i took an interest in such an imbecile but were astonished beyond measure that taking one golfer with another my choice should have fallen upon the poorest player of them all if for instance i had chosen to associate with young gilbert de belloeuvre apart from golf he was a boy who had the gift of conversation who had secured a proxime in the examinations and wrote quite good poetry as a matter of fact he was the stupidest of them all or again if my object had been to make a study for a book guy saumoy who was completely insane who had abducted two girls was at least a singular type who might interest me these two might have been allowed me but the other what attraction could i find in him he was the type of the great brute of the coarse brute to return to andres visit after the disclosure that she had just made to me of her relations with albertine she added that the chief reason for which albertine had left me was the thought of what her friends of the little band might think and other people as well when they saw her living like that with a young man to whom she was not married of course i know it was in your mothers house but that makes no difference you cant imagine what all those girls are like what they conceal from one another how they dread one anothers opinion i have seen them being terribly severe with young men simply because the men knew their friends and they were afraid that certain things might be repeated and those very girls i have happened to see them in a totally different light much to their disgust a few months earlier this knowledge which andre appeared to possess of the motives that swayed the girls of the little band would have seemed to me the most priceless thing in the world what she said was perhaps sufficient to explain why albertine who had given herself to me afterwards in paris had refused to yield to me at balbec where i was constantly meeting her friends which i had absurdly supposed to be so great an advantage in winning her affection perhaps indeed it was because she had seen me display some sign of intimacy with andre or because i had rashly told the latter that albertine was coming to spend the night at the grand hotel that albertine who perhaps an hour earlier was ready to let me take certain favours as though that were the simplest thing in the world had abruptly changed her mind and threatened to ring the bell but then she must have been accommodating to lots of others this thought rekindled my jealousy and i told andre that there was something that i wished to ask her you did those things in your grandmothers empty apartment oh no never we should have been disturbed why i thought    it seemed to me     besides albertine loved doing it in the country and where pray originally when she hadnt time to go very far we used to go to the butteschaumont she knew a house there or else we would lie under the trees there is never anyone about in the grotto of the petit trianon too there you see how am i to believe you you swore to me not a year ago that you had never done anything at the butteschaumont i was afraid of distressing you as i have said i thought although not until much later that on the contrary it was on this second occasion the day of her confessions that andre had sought to distress me and this thought would have occurred to me at once because i should have felt the need of it if i had still been as much in love with albertine but andres words did not hurt me sufficiently to make it indispensable to me to dismiss them immediately as untrue in short if what andre said was true and i did not doubt it at the time the real albertine whom i discovered after having known so many diverse forms of albertine differed very little from the young bacchanal who had risen up and whom i had detected on the first day on the front at balbec and who had offered me so many different aspects in succession as a town gradually alters the position of its buildings so as to overtop to obliterate the principal monument which alone we beheld from a distance as we approach it whereas when we know it well and can judge it exactly its true proportions prove to be those which the perspective of the first glance had indicated the rest through which we passed being no more than that continuous series of lines of defence which everything in creation raises against our vision and which we must cross one after another at the cost of how much suffering before we arrive at the heart if however i had no need to believe absolutely in albertines innocence because my suffering had diminished i can say that reciprocally if i did not suffer unduly at this revelation it was because some time since for the belief that i feigned in albertines innocence there had been substituted gradually and without my taking it into account the belief ever present in my mind in her guilt now if i no longer believed in albertines innocence it was because i had already ceased to feel the need the passionate desire to believe in it it is desire that engenders belief and if we fail as a rule to take this into account it is because most of the desires that create beliefs end  unlike the desire which had persuaded me that albertine was innocent  only with our own life to all the evidence that corroborated my original version i had stupidly preferred simple statements by albertine why had i believed them falsehood is essential to humanity it plays as large a part perhaps as the quest of pleasure and is moreover commanded by that quest we lie in order to protect our pleasure or our honour if the disclosure of our pleasure runs counter to our honour we lie all our life long especially indeed perhaps only to those people who love us such people in fact alone make us fear for our pleasure and desire their esteem i had at first thought albertine guilty and it was only my desire devoting to a process of doubt the strength of my intelligence that had set me upon the wrong track perhaps we live surrounded by electric seismic signs which we must interpret in good faith in order to know the truth about the characters of other people if the truth must be told saddened as i was in spite of everything by andres words i felt it to be better that the truth should at last agree with what my instinct had originally foreboded rather than with the miserable optimism to which i had since made a cowardly surrender i would have preferred that life should remain at the high level of my intuitions those moreover which i had felt that first day upon the beach when i had supposed that those girls embodied the frenzy of pleasure were vice incarnate and again on the evening when i had seen albertines governess leading that passionate girl home to the little villa as one thrust into its cage a wild animal which nothing in the future despite appearances will ever succeed in taming did they not agree with what bloch had told me when he had made the world seem so fair to me by shewing me making me palpitate on all my walks at every encounter the universality of desire perhaps when all was said it was better that i should not have found those first intuitions verified afresh until now while the whole of my love for albertine endured they would have made me suffer too keenly and it was better that there should have subsisted of them only a trace my perpetual suspicion of things which i did not see and which nevertheless happened continually so close to me and perhaps another trace as well earlier more vast which was my love itself was it not indeed despite all the denials of my reason tantamount to knowing albertine in all her hideousness merely to choose her to love her and even in the moments when suspicion is lulled is not love the persistence and a transformation of that suspicion is it not a proof of clairvoyance a proof unintelligible to the lover himself since desire going always in the direction of what is most opposite to ourselves forces us to love what will make us suffer certainly there enter into a persons charm into the attraction of her eyes her lips her figure the elements unknown to us which are capable of making us suffer most intensely so much so that to feel ourselves attracted by the person to begin to love her is however innocent we may pretend it to be to read already in a different version all her betrayals and her faults and those charms which to attract me materialised thus the noxious dangerous fatal parts of a person did they perhaps stand in a more direct relation of cause to effect to those secret poisons than do the seductive luxuriance and the toxic juice of certain venomous flowers it was perhaps i told myself albertines vice itself the cause of my future sufferings that had produced in her that honest frank manner creating the illusion that one could enjoy with her the same loyal and unrestricted comradeship as with a man just as a parellel vice had produced in m de charlus a feminine refinement of sensibility and mind through a period of the most utter blindness perspicacity persists beneath the very form of predilection and affection which means that we are wrong in speaking of a bad choice in love since whenever there is a choice it can only be bad did those excursions to the butteschaumont take place when you used to call for her here i asked andre oh no from the day when albertine came back from balbec with you except the time i told you about she never did anything again with me she would not even allow me to mention such things to her but my dear andre why go on lying to me by the merest chance for i never try to find out anything i have learned in the minutest details things of that sort which albertine did i can tell you exactly on the bank of the river with a laundress only a few days before her death ah perhaps after she had left you that i cant say she felt that she had failed that she would never again be able to regain your confidence these last words appalled me then i thought again of the evening of the branch of syringa i remembered that about a fortnight later as my jealousy kept seeking a fresh object i had asked albertine whether she had ever had relations with andre and she had replied oh never of course i adore andre i have a profound affection for her but as though we were sisters and even if i had the tastes which you seem to suppose she is the last person that would have entered my head i can swear to you by anything you like by my aunt by my poor mothers grave i had believed her and yet even if i had not been made suspicious by the contradiction between her former partial admissions with regard to certain matters and the firmness with which she had afterwards denied them as soon as she saw that i was not unaffected i ought to have remembered swann convinced of the platonic nature of m de charluss friendships and assuring me of it on the evening of the very day on which i had seen the tailor and the baron in the courtyard i ought to have reflected that if there are one covering the other two worlds one consisting of the things that the best the sincerest people say and behind it the world composed of those same peoples successive actions so that when a married woman says to you of a young man oh it is perfectly true that i have an immense affection for him but it is something quite innocent quite pure i could swear it upon the memory of my parents we ought ourselves instead of feeling any hesitation to swear that she has probably just come from her bathroom to which after every assignation that she has with the young man in question she dashes to prevent any risk of his giving her a child the spray of syringa made me profoundly sad as did also the discovery that albertine could have thought or called me cruel and hostile most of all perhaps certain lies so unexpected that i had difficulty in grasping them one day albertine had told me that she had been to an aerodrome that the airman was in love with her this doubtless in order to divert my suspicion from women thinking that i was less jealous of other men that it had been amusing to watch andres raptures at the said airman at all the compliments that he paid albertine until finally andre had longed to go in the air with him now this was an entire fabrication andre had never visited the aerodrome in question

   when andre left me it was dinnertime you will never guess who has been to see me and stayed at least three hours said my mother i call it three hours it was perhaps longer she arrived almost on the heels of my first visitor who was mme cottard sat still and watched everybody come and go  and i had more than thirty callers  and left me only a quarter of an hour ago if you hadnt had your friend andre with you i should have sent for you why who was it a person who never pays calls the princesse de parme why i have a cleverer son than i thought i had there is no fun in making you guess a name for you hit on it at once did she come to apologise for her rudeness yesterday no that would have been stupid the fact of her calling was an apology your poor grandmother would have thought it admirable it seems that about two oclock she had sent a footman to ask whether i had an athome day she was told that this was the day and so up she came my first thought which i did not dare mention to mamma was that the princesse de parme surrounded the day before by people of rank and fashion with whom she was on intimate terms and enjoyed conversing had when she saw my mother come into the room felt an annoyance which she had made no attempt to conceal and it was quite in the style of the great ladies of germany which for that matter the guermantes had largely adopted this stiffness for which they thought to atone by a scrupulous affability but my mother believed and i came in time to share her opinion that all that had happened was that the princesse de parme having failed to recognise her had not felt herself bound to pay her any attention that she had learned after my mothers departure who she was either from the duchesse de guermantes whom my mother had met as she was leaving the house or from the list of her visitors whose names before they entered her presence the servants recorded in a book she had thought it impolite to send word or to say to my mother i did not recognise you but  and this was no less in harmony with the good manners of the german courts and with the guermantes code of behaviour than my original theory  had thought that a call an exceptional action on the part of a royal personage and what was more a call of several hours duration would convey the explanation to my mother in an indirect but no less convincing form which is just what did happen but i did not waste any time in asking my mother to tell me about the princesss call for i had just recalled a number of incidents with regard to albertine as to which i had meant but had forgotten to question andre how little for that matter did i know should i ever know of this story of albertine the only story that could be of particular interest to me or did at least begin to interest me afresh at certain moments for man is that creature without any fixed age who has the faculty of becoming in a few seconds many years younger and who surrounded by the walls of the time through which he has lived floats within them but as though in a basin the surfacelevel of which is constantly changing so as to bring him into the range now of one epoch now of another i wrote to andre asking her to come again she was unable to do so until a week had passed almost as soon as she entered the room i said to her very well then since you maintain that albertine never did that sort of thing while she was staying here according to you it was to be able to do it more freely that she left me but for which of her friends certainly not it was not that at all then because i was too unkind to her no i dont think so i believe that she was forced to leave you by her aunt who had designs for her future upon that guttersnipe you know the young man whom you used to call i am in the soup the young man who was in love with albertine and had proposed for her seeing that you did not marry her they were afraid that the shocking length of her stay in your house might prevent the young man from proposing mme bontemps after the young man had brought continual pressure to bear upon her summoned albertine home albertine after all needed her uncle and aunt and when she found that they expected her to make up her mind she left you i had never in my jealousy thought of this explanation but only of albertines desire for other women and of my own vigilance i had forgotten that there was also mme bontemps who might presently regard as strange what had shocked my mother from the first at least mme bontemps was afraid that it might shock this possible husband whom she was keeping in reserve for albertine in case i failed to marry her was this marriage really the cause of albertines departure and out of selfrespect so as not to appear to be dependent on her aunt or to force me to marry her had she preferred not to mention it i was beginning to realise that the system of multiple causes for a single action of which albertine shewed her mastery in her relations with her girl friends when she allowed each of them to suppose that it was for her sake that she had come was only a sort of artificial deliberate symbol of the different aspects that an action assumes according to the point of view that we adopt the astonishment i might almost say the shame that i felt at never having even once told myself that albertine in my house was in a false position which might give offence to her aunt it was not the first nor was it the last time that i felt it how often has it been my lot after i have sought to understand the relations between two people and the crises that they bring about to hear all of a sudden a third person speak to me of them from his own point of view for he has even closer relations with one of the two a point of view which has perhaps been the cause of the crisis and if peoples actions remain so indefinite how should not the people themselves be equally indefinite if i listened to the people who maintained that albertine was a schemer who had tried to get one man after another to marry her it was not difficult to imagine how they would have defined her life with me and yet to my mind she had been a victim a victim who perhaps was not altogether pure but in that case guilty for other reasons on account of vices to which people did not refer but we must above all say to ourselves this on the one hand lying is often a trait of character on the other hand in women who would not otherwise be liars it is a natural defence improvised at first then more and more organised against that sudden danger which would be capable of destroying all life love on the other hand again it is not the effect of chance if men who are intelligent and sensitive invariably give themselves to insensitive and inferior women and are at the same time so attached to them that the proof that they are not loved does not in the least cure them of the instinct to sacrifice everything else in the attempt to keep such a woman with them if i say that such men need to suffer i am saying something that is accurate while suppressing the preliminary truths which make that need  involuntary in a sense  to suffer a perfectly comprehensible consequence of those truths without taking into account that complete natures being rare a man who is highly sensitive and highly intelligent will generally have little willpower will be the plaything of habit and of that fear of suffering in the immediate present which condemns us to perpetual suffering  and that in those conditions he will never be prepared to repudiate the woman who does not love him we may be surprised that he should be content with so little love but we ought rather to picture to ourselves the grief that may be caused him by the love which he himself feels a grief which we ought not to pity unduly for those terrible commotions which are caused by an unrequited love by the departure the death of a mistress are like those attacks of paralysis which at first leave us helpless but after which our muscles begin by degrees to recover their vital elasticity and energy what is more this grief does not lack compensation these sensitive and intelligent men are as a rule little inclined to falsehood this takes them all the more by surprise inasmuch as intelligent as they may be they live in the world of possibilities react little live in the grief which a woman has just inflicted on them rather than in the clear perception of what she had in mind what she was doing of the man with whom she was in love a perception granted chiefly to deliberate natures which require it in order to prepare against the future instead of lamenting the past and so these men feel that they are betrayed without quite knowing how wherefore the mediocre woman with whom we were surprised to see them fall in love enriches the universe for them far more than an intelligent woman would have done behind each of her words they feel that a lie is lurking behind each house to which she says that she has gone another house behind each action each person another action another person doubtless they do not know what or whom have not the energy would not perhaps find it possible to discover a lying woman by an extremely simple trick can beguile without taking the trouble to change her method any number of people and what is more the very person who ought to have discovered the trick all this creates in front of the sensitive and intelligent man a universe all depth which his jealousy would fain plumb and which is not without interest to his intelligence

   albeit i was not exactly a man of that category i was going perhaps now that albertine was dead to learn the secret of her life here again do not these indiscretions which occur only after a persons life on earth is ended prove that nobody believes really in a future state if these indiscretions are true we ought to fear the resentment of her whose actions we are revealing fully as much on the day when we shall meet her in heaven as we feared it so long as she was alive when we felt ourselves bound to keep her secret and if these indiscretions are false invented because she is no longer present to contradict them we ought to be even more afraid of the dead womans wrath if we believed in heaven but no one does believe in it so that it was possible that a long debate had gone on in albertines heart between staying with me and leaving me but that her decision to leave me had been made on account of her aunt or of that young man and not on account of women to whom perhaps she had never given a thought the most serious thing to my mind was that andre albeit she had nothing now to conceal from me as to albertines morals swore to me that nothing of the sort had ever occurred between albertine on the one hand and mlle vinteuil or her friend on the other albertine herself was unconscious of her own instincts when she first met the girls and they from that fear of making a mistake in the object of our desire which breeds as many errors as desire itself regarded her as extremely hostile to that sort of thing perhaps later on they had learned that her tastes were similar to their own but by that time they knew albertine too well and albertine knew them too well for there to be any thought of their doing things together in short i did not understand any better than before why albertine had left me if the face of a woman is perceived with difficulty by our eyes which cannot take in the whole of its moving surface by our lips still more by our memory if it is shrouded in obscurity according to her social position according to the level at which we are situated how much thicker is the veil drawn between the actions of her whom we see and her motives her motives are situated in a more distant plane which we do not perceive and engender moreover actions other than those which we know and often in absolute contradiction to them when has there not been some man in public life regarded as a saint by his friends who is discovered to have forged documents robbed the state betrayed his country how often is a great nobleman robbed by a steward whom he has brought up from childhood ready to swear that he was an honest man as possibly he was now this curtain that screens another persons motives how much more impenetrable does it become if we are in love with that person for it clouds our judgment and also obscures the actions of her who feeling that she is loved ceases at once to attach any value to what otherwise would doubtless have seemed to her important such as wealth for example perhaps moreover she is impelled to pretend to a certain extent this scorn of wealth in the hope of obtaining more money by making us suffer the bargaining instinct also may be involved and so with the actual incidents in her life an intrigue which she has confided to no one for fear of its being revealed to us which many people might for all that have discovered had they felt the same passionate desire to know it as ourselves while preserving freer minds arousing fewer suspicions in the guilty party an intrigue of which certain people have not been unaware  but people whom we do not know and should not know how to find and among all these reasons for her adopting an inexplicable attitude towards us we must include those idiosyncrasies of character which impel a person whether from indifference to his own interests or from hatred or from love of freedom or from sudden bursts of anger or from fear of what certain people will think to do the opposite of what we expected and then there are the differences of environment of upbringing in which we refuse to believe because when we are talking together they are effaced by our speech but which return when we are apart to direct the actions of each of us from so opposite a point of view that there is no possibility of their meeting but my dear andre you are lying again remember  you admitted it to me yourself  i telephoned to you the evening before you remember albertine had been so anxious and kept it from me as though it had been something that i must not know about to go to the afternoon party at the verdurins at which mlle vinteuil was expected yes but albertine had not the slightest idea that mlle vinteuil was to be there what you yourself told me that she had met mme verdurin a few days earlier besides andre there is no point in our trying to deceive one another i found a letter one morning in albertines room a note from mme verdurin begging her to come that afternoon and i shewed her the note which as a matter of fact franoise had taken care to bring to my notice by placing it on the surface of albertines possessions a few days before her departure and i am afraid leaving it there to make albertine suppose that i had been rummaging among her things to let her know in any case that i had seen it and i had often asked myself whether franoises ruse had not been largely responsible for the departure of albertine who saw that she could no longer conceal anything from me and felt disheartened vanquished i shewed andre the letter i feel no compunction everything is excused by this strong family feeling     you know very well andre that albertine used always to say that mlle vinteuils friend was indeed a mother an elder sister to her but you have misinterpreted this note the person that mme verdurin wished albertine to meet that afternoon was not at all mlle vinteuils friend it was the young man you call i am in the soup and the strong family feeling is what mme verdurin felt for the brute who is after all her nephew at the same time i think that albertine did hear afterwards that mlle vinteuil was to be there mme verdurin may have let her know separately of course the thought of seeing her friend again gave her pleasure reminded her of happy times in the past but just as you would be glad if you were going to some place to know that elstir would be there but no more than that not even as much no if albertine was unwilling to say why she wanted to go to mme verdurins it is because it was a rehearsal to which mme verdurin had invited a very small party including that nephew of hers whom you had met at balbec to whom mme bontemps was hoping to marry albertine and to whom albertine wanted to talk a fine lot of people and so albertine in spite of what andres mother used to think had had after all the prospect of a wealthy marriage and when she had wanted to visit mme verdurin when she spoke to her in secret when she had been so annoyed that i should have gone there that evening without warning her the plot that had been woven by her and mme verdurin had had as its object her meeting not mlle vinteuil but the nephew with whom albertine was in love and for whom mme verdurin was acting as gobetween with the satisfaction in working for the achievement of one of those marriages which surprise us in certain families into whose state of mind we do not enter completely supposing them to be intent upon a rich bride now i had never given another thought to this nephew who had perhaps been the initiator thanks to whom i had received her first kiss and for the whole plane of albertines motives which i had constructed i must now substitute another or rather superimpose it for perhaps it did not exclude the other a preference for women did not prevent her from marrying and anyhow there is no need to seek out all these explanations andre went on heaven only knows how i loved albertine and what a good creature she was but really after she had typhoid a year before you first met us all she was an absolute madcap all of a sudden she would be disgusted with what she was doing all her plans would have to be changed at once and she herself probably could not tell you why you remember the year when you first came to balbec the year when you met us all one fine day she made some one send her a telegram calling her back to paris she had barely time to pack her trunks but there was absolutely no reason for her to go all the excuses that she made were false paris was impossible for her at the moment we were all of us still at balbec the golf club wasnt closed indeed the heats for the cup which she was so keen on winning werent finished she was certain to win it it only meant staying on for another week well off she went i have often spoken to her about it since she said herself that she didnt know why she had left that she felt homesick the home being paris you can imagine how likely that was that she didnt feel happy at balbec that she thought that there were people there who were laughing at her and i told myself that there was this amount of truth in what andre said that if differences between minds account for the different impressions produced upon one person and another by the same work for differences of feeling for the impossibility of captivating a person to whom we do not appeal there are also the differences between characters the peculiarities of a single character which are also motives for action then i ceased to think about this explanation and said to myself how difficult it is to know the truth in this world i had indeed observed albertines anxiety to go to mme verdurins and her concealment of it and i had not been mistaken but then even if we do manage to grasp one fact like this there are others which we perceive only in their outward appearance for the reverse of the tapestry the real side of the action of the intrigue  as well as that of the intellect of the heart  is hidden from us and we see pass before us only flat silhouettes of which we say to ourselves it is this it is that it is on her account or on some ones else the revelation of the fact that mlle vinteuil was expected had seemed to me an explanation all the more logical seeing that albertine had anticipated it by mentioning her to me and subsequently had she not refused to swear to me that mlle vinteuils presence gave her no pleasure and here with regard to this young man i remembered a point which i had forgotten a little time earlier while albertine was staying with me i had met him and he had been  in contradiction of his attitude at balbec  extremely friendly even affectionate with me had begged me to allow him to call upon me which i had declined to do for a number of reasons and now i realised that it was simply because knowing that albertine was staying in the house he had wished to be on good terms with me so as to have every facility for seeing her and for carrying her off from me and i concluded that he was a scoundrel some time later when i attended the first performances of this young mans works no doubt i continued to think that if he had been so anxious to call upon me it was for albertines sake but while i felt this to be reprehensible i remembered that in the past if i had gone down to doncieres to see saintloup it was really because i was in love with mme de guermantes it is true that the situation was not identical since saintloup had not been in love with mme de guermantes with the result that there was in my affection for him a trace of duplicity perhaps but no treason but i reflected afterwards that this affection which we feel for the person who controls the object of our desire we feel equally if the person controls that object while loving it himself no doubt we have then to struggle against a friendship which will lead us straight to treason and i think that this is what i have always done but in the case of those who have not the strength to struggle we cannot say that in them the friendship that they affect for the controller is a mere ruse they feel it sincerely and for that reason display it with an ardour which once the betrayal is complete means that the betrayed husband or lover is able to say with a stupefied indignation if you had heard the protestations of affection that the wretch showered on me that a person should come to rob a man of his treasure that i can understand but that he should feel the diabolical need to assure him first of all of his friendship is a degree of ignominy and perversity which it is impossible to imagine now there is no such perversity in the action nor even an absolutely clear falsehood the affection of this sort which albertines pseudofianc had manifested for me that day had yet another excuse being more complex than a simple consequence of his love for albertine it had been for a short time only that he had known himself confessed himself been anxious to be proclaimed an intellectual for the first time values other than sporting or amatory existed for him the fact that i had been regarded with esteem by elstir by bergotte that albertine had perhaps told him of the way in which i criticised writers which led her to imagine that i might myself be able to write had the result that all of a sudden i had become to him to the new man who he at last realised himself to be an interesting person with whom he would like to be associated to whom he would like to confide his plans whom he would ask perhaps for an introduction to elstir with the result that he was sincere when he asked if he might call upon me expressing a regard for me to which intellectual reasons as well as the thought of albertine imparted sincerity no doubt it was not for that that he was so anxious to come and see me and would have sacrificed everything else with that object but of this last reason which did little more than raise to a sort of impassioned paroxysm the two other reasons he was perhaps unaware himself and the other two existed really as might have existed really in albertine when she had been anxious to go on the afternoon of the rehearsal to mme verdurins the perfectly respectable pleasure that she would feel in meeting again friends of her childhood who in her eyes were no more vicious than she was in theirs in talking to them in shewing them by the mere fact of her presence at the verdurins that the poor little girl whom they had known was now invited to a distinguished house the pleasure also that she might perhaps have felt in listening to vinteuils music if all this was true the blush that had risen to albertines cheeks when i mentioned mlle vinteuil was due to what i had done with regard to that afternoon party which she had tried to keep secret from me because of that proposal of marriage of which i was not to know albertines refusal to swear to me that she would not have felt any pleasure in meeting mlle vinteuil again at that party had at the moment intensified my torment strengthened my suspicions but proved to me in retrospect that she had been determined to be sincere and even over an innocent matter perhaps simply because it was an innocent matter there remained what andre had told me about her relations with albertine perhaps however even without going so far as to believe that andre had invented the story solely in order that i might not feel happy and might not feel myself superior to her i might still suppose that she had slightly exaggerated her account of what she used to do with albertine and that albertine by a mental restriction diminished slightly also what she had done with andre making use systematically of certain definitions which i had stupidly formulated upon the subject finding that her relations with andre did not enter into the field of what she was obliged to confess to me and that she could deny them without lying but why should i believe that it was she rather than andre who was lying truth and life are very arduous and there remained to me from them without my really knowing them an impression in which sorrow was perhaps actually dominated by exhaustion

   as for the third occasion on which i remember that i was conscious of approaching an absolute indifference with regard to albertine and on this third occasion i felt that i had entirely arrived at it it was one day at venice a long time after andres last visitembed"

i'm a slave to your games i'm just a sucker for pain
i wanna chain you up i wanna tie you down
oooohh i'm just a sucker for pain
verse 3 lil wayne
uhh devoted to destruction
a full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
i'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
see i'm a fool for pain i'm a dummy
might cut my head off right after i slit my throat
tongue kiss a shark got jealous bitches up in the boat
eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
and if i get stung i get stoked might choke
like i chewed a chunk of charcoal naked in the north pole
that's why my heart cold full of sorrow the lost soul
and only lord knows when i'm coming to the crossroads
so i don't fear shit but tomorrow
and i'm a sucker for pain it ain't nuttin' but pain
you just fuckin' complain you ain't tough as you claim
just stay up in your lane just don't fuck with lil wayne
i'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'cause i'm a sucker for pain
verse 4 wiz khalifa
used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
no pain no gain
never stand down made our own way
never going slow we pick up the pace
this is what we wanted from a young age
no emotion that's what business is
lord have mercy on the witnesses

ain't no way to explain or say
how painful the hangover was today
in front of the toilet hands and knees
trying to breathe in between the dry heaves
my baby made me some coffee
afraid that if i drink some it's probably coming right back out me
couple of advil relax and chill
at a standstill with how bad i feel
i think i need to smell fresh air
so i stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs
the sunlight hit me dead in the eye
like it's mad that i gave half the day to last night
my bad sight made me trip on my ass right into that patch of grass like that's life
all of a sudden i realize something
the weather is amazing even the birds are bumpin
stood up and took a look and a breath
and there's that bike that i forgot that i possessed
never really seen exercise as friendly
but i think something's telling me to ride that 10 speed
the brakes are broken it's alright
the tires got air and the chain seems tight
hopped on and felt the summertime
it reminds me of one of them musab lines like

hook

bust it out whenever someone's actin hard
settle down barbeque in the backyard
the kids get treats and old folks get classic cars
every day that gets to pass is a success
and every woman looks better in a sun dress
the sunshine's an excuse to shoot hoops get juice
show improve their moves and let loose
i hear voices i see smiles to match em
good times and you can feel it in the fashion
even though the heat cooks up the action
the streets still got butterflies
enough kids to catch 'em
ridin my bike around these lakes man
feelin like i finally figured out my escape plan
take it all and the day started off all wrong
somehow now that hangover is all gone
ain't nothing like the sound of the leaves
when the breeze penetrates these southside trees
leanin' up against one watchin the vibe
forgettin' all about the stress thanking god i'm alive
it's so simple i had to keep the song simple
when i get home i'm gonna open all the windows

'cause sometimes you just feel tired
yo left yo left
feel weak and when you feel weak

you feel like you wanna just give up
yo left yo left
but you gotta search within you
yo left right left
try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
yo left yo left
and get that motivation to not give up
yo left right left
and not be a quitter no matter how bad
yo left yo left
you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
yo left right left

verse 1 eminem
'til i collapse i'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killin' 'em
cause when i am not then i'ma stop pennin' 'em
and i am not hiphop and i'm just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when i'ma stop sendin' 'em
women are caught in webs spin 'em and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
amoxicillin's just not real enough

a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
you're comin' with me feel it or not
you're gonna fear it like i showed ya the spirit of god lives in us

verse 2 eminem
music is like magic there's a certain feelin' you get
when you real and you spit and people are feelin' your shit
this is your moment and every single minute you spend
tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
so while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
it goes reggie jayz 2pac and biggie
andr from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy
so when i'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
that's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
you hate it but you know respect you got to give me

verse 3 eminem
soon as a verse starts i eat at an mc's heart
what is he thinking how not to go against me smart
and it's absurd how people hang on every word
i'll prob'ly never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin' could ever be worse
that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like i'm an addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers
but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a fullblown attack i'm launchin' at 'em
the track is on some battlin' raps who wants some static
cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is wack if i'm not the baddest so

and what befel them of things seldseen and peregrinefn138

the king asked her and what was their story and she answered it hath reached me o auspicious king that there was in the city of safety baghdad before the caliphate of abd almalik bin marwnfn139 a king omar bin alnu'umn highs who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the chosros of persia and the kaysars of eastern rome for none could warm himself at his firefn140 nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray and when he was angered there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame he had made himself king over all quarters and allah had subjected to him all his creatures his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands east and west had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them hind and sind and sinfn141 the holy land alhijaz the rich mountains of alyaman and the archipelagos of india and china moreover he reigned supreme over the north country and diyr bakr or mesopotamia and over sudn the eastern negro land and the islands of the ocean and all the far famed rivers of the earth sayhn and jayhnfn142 nile and euphrates he sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote to provide him with true report and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for king omar bin alnu'uman for he was o ruler of the age a right noble king and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing this mighty monarch had a son yclept sharrkanfn143 who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban for this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater and made him heir to the kingdom after himself this prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old and allah subjected his servants to him by reason of his great might and prowess in battle now his father king omar had four wives legally married but allah had vouchsafed him no son by them save sharrkan whom he had begotten upon one of them and the rest were barren moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines after the number of days in the coptic year who were of all nations and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace for he had built twelve pavilions after the number of the months each containing thirty private chambers which thus numbered three hundred and three score wherein he lodged his handmaids and he appointed according to law for each one her night when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full yearfn144 and on this wise he abode for a length of time meanwhile his son sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities presently by decree of the decreer a handmaid among the handmaids of omar bin nu'uman became pregnant and her pregnancy being announced to the harim the king was informed thereof whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said haply it will be a son and so all my offspring will be males then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness but when the tidings came to sharrkan he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous and he said verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty so quoth he to himself if this concubine bear a male child i will kill it but he kept that intention hidden in his heart such was the case with sharrkan but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows she was a roumiyah a greek girl by name sofiyah or sophiafn145 whom the king of roum and lord of csarea had sent to king omar as a present together with great store of gifts and of rarities she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating now she had served the king on the night of his sleeping with her saying to him o king i desire of the god of the heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me so i may bring him up with the best of rearing and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence good manners and prudent bearingfn146a speech which much pleased the king during her pregnancy she was instant in prayer fervently supplicating the lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her and allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stoolfn147 now the king had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female and in like way his son sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same in due time sophia was delivered of a child which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon so they announced this to all present in the room whereupon the king's messenger carried the news to him and sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy but after the two had departed quoth sophia to the midwives wait with me awhile for i feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her and allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child the wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon with forehead flower white and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light whereupon the mother rejoiced as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company and sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joyfn148 the rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot and the tidings reached omar son of al nu'uman who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news then he rose and went to her and kissed her head after which he looked at the boy and bending over him kissed him whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music and the king gave order that the boy should be named zau almakn and his sister nuzhat alzamnfn149 they answered hearing and obedience and did his bidding so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside beyond the power of tongue to rehearse moreover the people of baghdad hearing that allah had blessed their king with issue decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom and the emirs and wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished king omar bin alnu'uman joy of his son zau almakan and of his daughter nuzhat alzaman wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts and dealt largesse to all gentle and simple who were present after this fashion he did for four days full told and he lavished upon sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth and every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the newborns and when four years had gone by he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions all this while his son sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father omar son of alnu'uman having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of nuzhat alzaman and they hid the intelligence from him until days and years had sped by whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights one day as king omar was sitting in his palace his chamberlains came in to him and kissing the ground before him said o king there be come ambassadors from the king of roum lord of constantinople the great and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree if the king commend us to introduce them we will so do and if not there is no disputing his behest he bade them enter and when they came in he turned to them and courteously receiving them asked them of their case and what was the cause of their coming they kissed the ground before him and said o king glorious and strong o lord of the arm that is long know that he who despatched us to thee is king afrdnfn150 lord of ionia landfn151 and of the nazarene armies the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of constantinople to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel the prince of casarea and the cause of this war is as follows one of the kings of the arabs in past time during certain of his conquests chanced upon a hoard of the time of alexanderfn152 whence he removed wealth past compute and amongst other things three round jewels big as ostrich eggs from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man upon each were graven characts in ionian characters and they have many virtues and properties amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a newborn child no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without failfn153 when the arab king laid hands upon them and learned their secrets he sent to king afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned and he equipped for the mission two ships one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels for that he was king of the arabs and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the king of constantinople and they were bound to his port nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the great king afridun the two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the prince of caesarea who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships together with the three jewels and slew the crews when our king heard of this he sent an army against them but they routed it then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flightwhereupon the king waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forthfn154 against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army nor would he turn back from them till he had left caesarea of armeniafn155 in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her prince held sway so he sent us to the lord of the age and the time sultan omar bin alnu'uman king of baghdad and of khorasan desiring that he aid us with an army so may honour and glory accrue to him and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents and of the king's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance then the ambassadors kissed the ground before himand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fortysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that after the ambassadors and retinue from the constantinopolitan king had kissed the ground before omar and had delivered their embassage they brought out the presents which were fifty damsels of the choicest from graecialand and fifty mamelukes in tunics of brocade belted with girdles of gold and silver each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one the girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money when the king saw them he rejoiced in them and accepted them then he bade the ambassadors be honourably entreated and summoning his wazirs took counsel with them of what he should do herewith rose up among them a wazir an ancient man dandanfn156 highs who kissed the ground before omar and said o king there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious and set over it thy son sharrkan with us as his lieutenants and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts first because the king of roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted and secondly because while no enemy dareth attack our country thine army may go forth safely and should it succour the king of graecialand and defeat his foe the glory will be thine moreover the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially when the tidings shall reach the islands of the ocean and the kings of mauritania shall hear it they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money the king pleased by the wazir's words and approving his rede gave him a dress of honour and said to him of the like of thee should kings ask counsel and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son sharrkan command the main battle then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down and he expounded to him the matter telling him what the ambassadors and the wazir dandan had said and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign enjoining him not to gainsay dandan in aught he should do moreover he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen armed cappie and inured to onset and stress of war accordingly sharrkan arose on the instant and chose out a myriad of horsemen after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them saying ye have delay of three days they kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions and provide provisions for the occasion whilst sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others when the appointed three days were ended the army drew out to the suburbs of baghdad cityfn157 and king omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the king seven parcels of moneyfn158 then he turned to danden and commended to his care the army of his son and the wazir kissed the ground before him and answered i hear and i obey and lastly he charged sharrkan that he should consult the wazir on all occasions which he promised to do after this the king returned to his city and sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array so they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen besides footmen and camp followers then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled whilst sharrkan mounted horse with the wazir dandan by his side and the colours fluttering over their heads so the host fared forth and stinted not faring with the ambassadors preceding them till day departed and night drew nigh when they alighted and encamped for the night and as soon as allah caused the morn tomorrow they mounted and tried on guided by the ambassadors for a space of twenty days and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious wady well grown with trees and shrubbery here sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt so they dismounted and pitched their tents spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley whilst the wazir dandan and the ambassadors of king afridun pitched in the sole of the wadyfn159 as for sharrkan he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides he then slacked the reins of his steed being minded to explore the wady and to mount guard in his own person because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of graecia land and in the enemy's country so he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the wazir dandan and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him so that he could no longer urge horse with heel now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback so when slumber overpowered him he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thicketsfn160 which was dense with growth but sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons eastern and western he was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great but as he rode on in fear of wild beasts behold the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of paradise and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men so king sharrkan alighted and tying his steed to one of the trees went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in arabic and saying now by the crush of the messiah this is not well of you but whose utters a word i will throw her and truss her up with her own girdlefn161 he kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold a stream was gushing and flowing and antelopes at large were frisking and roving and wild cattle amid the pasture moving and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs even as a poet described it in these couplets

most beautiful is earth in budding bloom  when lucid waters
            course through plain and wood
no work but his th' all great th' all glorious  giver of all
            gifts giver of all good

and as sharrkan considered the place he saw in it a christian monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moonfn162 through the midst of the convent passed a stream the water flowing amongst its gardens and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder high bosomed virgins as saith of them the poet in these couplets

the mead is bright with what is on't  of merry maidens
            debonnair
double its beauty and its grace  those trooping damsels slender
           fair
virgins of graceful swimming gait  ready with eye and lip to
            ensnare
and like the tendril'd vine they loose  the rich profusion of
            their hair
shooting their shafts and arrows from  beautiful eyes beyond
          compare
overpowering and transpiercing  every froward adversaire
sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright and temple locks like the scorpion's tail and she was perfect in essence and attributes as the poet said of her in these couplets

she beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance  and her
            straight slender stature enshamed the lance
she burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red  where all manner of
            beauties have habitance
and the locks on her forehead were lowering as night  whence
            issues a dawn tide of happiest chance

then sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids come ye on that i may wrestle with you and gravel you ere the moon set and the dawn break so each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright and pinioned them with their girdles and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all then there turned to her an old woman who was before her and the beldam said as in wrath o strumpet cost thou glory in grounding these girls behold i am an old woman yet have i thrown them forty times so what hast thou to boast of but if thou have the strength to wrestle with me stand up that i may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels the young lady smiled at her words but she was filled with inward wrath and she jumped up and asked o my lady zat aldawahifn163 by the truth of the messiah wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed or dost thou jest with me and she answered yeaand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fortyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the young lady asked zat aldawahi by the truth of the messiah wilt wrestle with me or dost jest and she answered yea i will wrestle with thee in very deed sharrkan looking on the while the damsel cried rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do when the old woman heard this she raged with exceeding rage and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehogfn164 then she sprang to her feet whilst the damsel stood up to her and said now by the truth of the messiah i will not wrestle with thee unless i be naked mistress whorefn165 so she loosed her petticoat trousers and putting her hand under her clothes tore them off her body then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head if ritah or a spotted snake with this she inclined towards the damsel and said do thou as i have done all this time sharrkan was gazing at the twain and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance so the damsel leisurely rose and taking a sash of yamani stuff passed it twice round her waist then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal smooth and rounded and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples as it were a bed of nu'uman's anemones and breasts like double pomegranates then the old woman leant towards her and the two laid hold either of each while sharrkan raised his head heavenwards and prayed allah that the belle might beat the beldam presently the young woman get beneath the old woman and gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand hoisted her off the ground with both whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and in so doing fell on her back arsiversy with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine furthermore she let fly two great fartsfn166 one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of heaven sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground then he arose and baring his brand looked right and left but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back and said to himself he lied not who named thee lady of calamities verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others so he drew near them to hear what should pass between them then the young lady went up to the old one and throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying o my lady zat al dawahi i intended only to throw thee and not all this but thou triedst to twist out of my hands so laud to allah for safety she returned her no answer but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned with the fair damsel standing amongst them quoth sharrkan to himself every luck hath its cause sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me so he made towards his steed and mounted and heeledfn167 him on when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath which he brandished shouting the while his war cry allah is all mightyfn168 when the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and taking firm stand on the bank of the stream whose breadth was six ells the normal cubits made one bound and landed clear on the farther sidefn169 where she turned and cried out with a loud voice who art thou o thou fellow that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host whence camest thou and whither art thou going speak sooth for truth will stand thee in good stead and lie not for lies come of villein breed doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies for thou art now in an open plain and did we shout but a single shout would come to our rescue four thousand knightsfn170 so tell me what thou wantest and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road we will do so when sharrkan heard her words he replied i am a stranger of the moslems who fared forth this night single handed seeking for spoil nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens so i shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them quoth she i would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it and as for the handmaids by allah they shall never be thy spoil have i not told thee that to lie is villein vile quoth he the wise man is he who taketh warning by others thereupon quoth she by the truth of the messiah did i not fear that thy death would be on my hands i would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might but i take pity upon the stranger so if thou seek booty i require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me by thy faith that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand and we will wrestle i and thou if thou throw me set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty but if i throw thee thou shalt become under my command swear this to me for i fear thy treachery indeed it hath become a common saw 'where perfidy is innate there trust is a weakly mate' now an thou wilt swear i will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee answered sharrkan and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul truly she knoweth not that i am a champion of champions swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding and i will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest 'draw near that i wrestle with thee' if thou throw me i have money where withal to ransom myself and if i throw thee 'twill be booty and booty enough for me rejoined the damsel i am content herewith and sharrkan was astounded at her words and said and by the truth of the apostle whom allah bless and keep i too am content on the other part then said she swear to me by him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling else mayst thou die without the pale of al islam sharrkan replied by allah were a kazi to swear me even though he were a kazi of the kazisfn171 he would not impose upon me such an oath as this then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree but he was drowned in the sea of thought saying in himself praise be to him who fashioned her from dirty waterfn172 then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling and said to her cross the stream to me but she replied it is not for me to come over to thee if thou wilt pass thou over here to me i cannot do that quoth he and quoth she o boy i will come across to thee so she tucked up her skirts and leaping landed on the other side of the stream by his side whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palmsfn173 but he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness for he saw a shape which the hand of power had tanned with the dye leaves of the jann which had been fostered by the hand of beneficence and fanned by the zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted then she called out to him o moslem come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd which illumined the whole place with its whiteness and sharrkan was dazzled by it then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge she doing the like and caught hold of her and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle breeding languishment and he fell a trembling like the persian reed in the roaring gale so she lifted him up and throwing him to the ground sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand for his soul had lost mastery over his senses then she asked him o moslem the slaying of nazarenes is lawful to you folk what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself and he answered o my lady thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful for our prophet mohammed whom allah bless and preserve prohibited the slaying of women and children old men and monks as it was thus revealed to your prophet she replied it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy so rise i give thee thy life for generosity is never lost upon the generous then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib even women and she said to him be not ashamed but verily one who entereth the land of roum in quest of booty and cometh to assist kings against kings how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib 'twas not for lack of strength in me he answered nor didst thou throw me by thy force it was thy loveliness overthrew me so if thou wilt grant me another bout it will be of thy courtesy she laughed and said i grant thee thy request but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary and it were only right i should loose them for haply this next wrestling bout will be long then she went to the slave girls and unbinding them said to them in the tongue of greece get ye to some safe place till i foil this moslem's lust and longing for you so they went away whilst sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers but when he felt waist touch waist his strength failed him and she waxing ware of this lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding levenflash and threw him to the ground he fell on his backfn174 and then she said to him rise i give thee thy life a second time i spared thee in the first count because of thy prophet for that he made unlawful the slaying of women and i do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood but i charge thee if there be in the moslem army sent by omar bin alnu'uman to succour the king of constantinople a stronger than thou send him hither and tell him of me for in wrestling there are shifts and trips catches and holds such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip the hug the feetcatch the thigh litefn175 the jostle and the leglock by allah o my lady quoth sharrkan and indeed he was highly incensed against her had i been master alsafd master mohammed kiml or ibn alsaddfn176 as they were in their prime i had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest for o my mistress by allah thou hast not grassed me by thy strength but by the blandishments of thy back parts for we men of mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight but now an thou wish thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three moreover i have regained my presence of mind when she heard his words she said to him hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling o vanquished one however come on an thou wilt but know that this must be the last round then she bent forward and challenged him and sharrkan did likewise setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him o moslem thou art now on thy mettle yes he replied thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round after which each of us will wend a different way she laughed and he laughed toofn177 then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back she laughed at him and said art thou an eater of bran thou are like a badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the father of windsfn178 that droppeth before a puff of air fie upon thee o thou poor thing adding get thee back to the moslem army and send us other than thyself for thou fairest of thews and proclaim for us among the arabs and persians the turks and daylamitesfn179 whoso hath might in him let him come to us then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to sharrkan laughing parting with thee is right grievous to me o my lord but get thee to thy mates before dawn lest the knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and knights sharrkan was confounded and called to her as she turned from him making towards the convent o my lady wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger the broken hearted slave of love so she turned to him laughing and said what is thy want i will grant thee thy prayer have i set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy replied he and shall i return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality i who have become one of thy servitors none baulk kindliness save the base she rejoined honour us in allah's name on my head and eyes be it mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me for now thou art my guest at this sharrkan was glad and hastening back to his horse mounted and walked him abreast of her and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridgefn180 built of beams of the white poplar hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks when sharrkan looked he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts and as she came up to them she said to one in the greek tongue arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent so she went up to sharrkan and led him over much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw and saying to himself o would that the wazir dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours then he turned to the young lady and said to her o marvel of loveliness now i have two claims upon thee first the claim of good fellowship and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality i am now under thy commandance and thy guidance so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of alislam where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who i am when she heard this she was angered and said to him by the truth of the messiah thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit but now i see what mischief there is in thy heart and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent how should i do as thou sayest when i wot that if i came to that king of yours omar bin al nu'uman i should never get free from him for truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls lord of baghdad and of khorasan though he be who hath built for himself twelve pavilions in number as the months of the year and in each a concubine after the number of the days and if i come to him he would not prove shy of me for your folk believe i am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ 'or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves'fn181 so how canst thou speak thus to me as for thy saying 'thou shalt look upon the braves of the moslems' by the truth of the messiah thou sayest that which is not true for i saw your army when it reached our land these two days ago and i did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of kings but i beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together and as to thy words 'thou shalt know who i am' i did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me even wert thou sharrkan omar bin al nu'uman's son the prowess name in these days knowest thou sharrkan asked he and she answered yes and i know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the king of constantinople o my lady said sharrkan i adjure thee by thy religion tell me the cause of all this that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth and with whom the fault lies now by the virtue of thy faith she replied did i not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that i am of the daughters of roum i would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader the wazir dandan and vanquish their champion sharrkanfn182 nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby for i have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the arabs but i have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women nor indeed had sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him 'clear this stream' could he have done it and i only long and lust that the messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent that i might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fortyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the nazarene damsel said to sharrkan and he listening impatiently enow verily if sharrkan fell into my hands i would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating

an faulty of one fault the beauty prove  her charms a thousand advocates shall move

so she went up and sharrkan after her and when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other like rollers in the rolling sea he extemporised these couplets 

for her sins is a pleader that brow  and all hearts its fair
             pleading must bow
when i saw it i cried to night  the moon at its fullest doth
            show
tho' balkis' own ifritfn183 try a bout  spite his force she
            would deal him a throw
the two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway this she opened and ushered sharrkan into a long vestibule vaulted with ten connected arches from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire the handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gemsfn184 and went on before her sharrkan still following till they reached the inner convent there the moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold the monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold whence the water ran like molten silver whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for kings then said the damsel ascend o my lord this throne so he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him she hath gone to her dormitory but we will serve thee even as she ordered so they set before him viands of rare varieties and he ate his sufficiency when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver and he washed his hands then his thoughts reverted to his army knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions so he was troubled about his case repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated

i am not lost to prudence but indeed  here i'm bewildered
            what shall be my rede
would any aid me in mine ails of love  by my own might and
            sleight would i be free'd
but ah my heart is lost and passionshent  to none save allah
          can i trust my need

when he ended his verse behold there came up to him a rare show and a fair more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her she was clad in brocades befitting kings her breasts were like twin pomegranates a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystalfn185 supporting a silvern shaft when sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight and he forgot army and wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead he sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness and cried aloud beware and beware of that zone rarely fair and broke out into these couplets

with heavy back parts high breasts delicate  and lissome form
           that sways with swimming gait
she deftly hides love longing in her breast  but i may never
           hide its ban and bate
while hosts of followers her steps precedefn186  like pearls
            now necklaced and now separate

she gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him when she came up to him and said in very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee o sharrkan how sped thy night o hero after we went away and left thee adding verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful especially in great kings and thou art crown prince sharrkan son and heir of king omar bin alnu'uman so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite and as thou art pierced by the shaft of fate be resignation thine and abide content to wait when he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth saying i am sharrkan bin omar bin alnu'uman whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place so whatso thou willest do it in my case she hung her head groundwards a long while then turned to him and said be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clearfn187 for thou art the guest of my hospitality and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard have no fear for by the truth of the messiah if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee till life had left my body for thy sake indeed thou art now under the charge of the messiah and of me hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him she would have done so during the past night presently she bespoke in the grecian tongue one of her slave girls who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food but sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself haply she hath put somewhat in this meat she knew what was in his thought so she turned to him and said by the truth of the messiah the case is not on such wise nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest had my mind been set on slaying thee i had slain thee ere now then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful where upon sharrkan came forward and ate too she was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied they washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour wines of all colours and kinds and a wineservice with vessels of gold silver and crystal she filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him even as she had done with the food then she crowned a second and handed it to him he drank and she said to him o moslem see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life and she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink till he took leave of his wits and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fortyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her presently she said to the slave girl o marjanahfn188 bring us some instruments of music to hear is to obey said the hand maid and going out returned in the twinkling of an eye with a damascus lutefn189 a persian harp a tartar pipe and an egyptian dulcimer the young lady took the lute and after tuning each several string began in gentle undersong to sing softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than tasminfn190 spring with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following

allah assain those eyne what streams of blood they shed  how
           many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped
i love all lovers who to lovers show them cure  'twere wrong to
           rue the love in wrong head born and bred
haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens  heaven help
          the hapless heart by force of thee misled
thou doomest me to death who art my king and i  ransom with
          life the deemster who would doom me dead
thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument played and recited couplets in the roumi tongue then their mistress sang also and seeing sharrkan in ecstasies asked him o moslem dost thou understand what i say and he answered nay my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips she laughed and continued if i sing to thee in arabic what wouldst thou do i should no longer quoth he be master of my senses then she took an instrument and changing the measure began singing these verses

the smack of parting's myrrh to me  how then bear patience'
            alo
i'm girt by ills in trinity  severance distance
             cruelty
my freedom stole that fairest she  and parting irks me
            bitterly

when she ended her verse she looked at sharrkan and found him lost to existence and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidensfn191 then he revived and remembering the songs again inclined to mirth and merriment and the twain returned to their wine and wassail and continued their playing and toying their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when sharrkan asked after her they answered she is gone to her sleeping chamber whereto he rejoined under allah's ward and his good guard as soon as it was morning a handmaid came to him and said to him my mistress biddeth thee to her so he rose and followed her and as he drew near her lodging the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams about the saloon were figures carved in human form and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within so that the beholder would fancy they spokefn192 here sat the young lady looking at the figures but when she saw sharrkan she sprang to her feet and taking him by the hand made him sit down by her side and asked him how he had passed the night he blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love and he answered yes i wot somewhat in verse on that matter let me hear it quoth she so he began quoting

pleasure and health good cheer good appetite  to azzah
           freest with our name and fame
by allah would i near her off she flies  at tangent granting
           less the more i claim
i dote on azzah but when clear i off  my rivals clears me too
           that dearest dame
like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud  which ere
            siesta done thin air became

when she heard this she said verily alkuthayyirfn193 was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste and he was superlative in his praise of azzah when he sang and she began to recite

did azzah deal behest to sun o' noon  the judge had judged her
             beauty's bestest boon
and girls who come to me and carp at her  god make their rosy
           cheeks her sandalshoon

and indeed quoth she 'twas said that azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness then she asked sharrkan saying o prince cost thou know aught of jamil'sfn194 verses to buthaynah if so repeat to us somewhat of them and he answered yes i know them better than any whereupon he began repeating these couplets

jamil in holy war go fight to me they say  what war save
            fight for fair ones would i e'er essay
to me their every word and work are mere delight  and martyrs
           crepe i all they slay in fight and fray
an ask i 'o buthaynah what's this love i pray  which eats
            my heart' quoth she ' 'twill stay for ever and aye'
and when i cry 'of wits return some small display  for daily
            use' quoth she 'far far 'tis fled away
thou seekst my death naught else thy will can satisfy  while i
             no goal espy save thee and thee alway'

thou hast spoken right well said she o king's son and jamil also spoke excellently well but what would buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich

'thou seekst my death naught else thy will can satisfy'

o my lady quoth sharrkan she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me and even that will not satisfy thee she laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till day put out her light and night came in darkness dight then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept while sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned as soon as he awoke the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment as wont and kissing the ground between his hands said to him bismillah in allah's name be so kind as to comefn195 our mistress biddeth thee to her presence so he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him playing on tabrets and other instruments of music till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts passing all description sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting

he plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry  and her breast
           pearls that bedded in gold mine lie
pure water on silvern bars is her brow  and her cheeks show
             roses with rubies vie
meseems in her eyne that the violet's hue  lies purpling set in
            the ithmid'sfn196 dye
when the lady saw sharrkan she stood up to him in honour and
taking his hand seated him by her side and asked o son of king
omar bin alnu'uman hast thou any cunning in the game of chess
yes he answered but do not thou with me as said the poet
'i speak and longing love upties me and unties me  till with
             her honey dew of inner lip she plies me
i brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me  with
            white and blackfn197 but black cum white ne'er satisfies
             me
'twas as if king for castle i were fain to place me  till wilful
             loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me
and if i seek to read intent in eyes that eye me  oh man that
             glance askance with hint of wish defies me'

then she brought the chessboard and played with him but sharrkan instead of looking at her moves kept gazing at her fair mouth and putting knight in place of elephant and elephantfn198 instead of knight she laughed and said to him if thy play be after this fashion thou knowest naught of the game this is only our first replied he judge not by this bout when she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her but she beat him a second time a third a fourth and a fifth so she turned to him and said thou art beaten in everything and he replied o my lady how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten then she bade bring food and they ate and washed their hands after which the wine was set before them and they drank presently she took the dulcimer for her hand was cunning in smiting it and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets

twixt the close tied and open wide no medium fortune knoweth 
            now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness
             showeth
then drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost
             find her  anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good
             forth goeth

they ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first when darkness set in the lady betook her to her dormitory leaving him alone with the hand maids so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up and they carried him to their mistress who came to meet him and taking him by the hand seated him by her side then she asked him how he had passed his night whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised

ne'er incline thee to part  which embitters the heart
e'en the sun when he sets  shall in pallor depart

while they were solacing themselves after this fashion behold there arose a great and sudden clamour and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands and cried aloud in the grecian tongue thou hast fallen into our hands o sharrkan so make thee sure of death when he heard this he said to himself by allah she hath entrapped me and held me in play till her men should come these are the knights with whom she threatened me but 'tis i who have thrown myself into this strait then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd who are ye o most gracious princess and peerless onion pearl answered the leading knight dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side not i she replied who may he be quoth the patrician this is of towns the highwayman this is he who rideth in the horseman's van this is sharrkan son of king omar bin alnu'uman this is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place the news of him reached king hardub thy father by report of the ancient dame zat al dawahi and thy sire our sovereign hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the greeks by taking captive this ominous lion when she heard this she looked at the knight and asked him what be thy name and he answered i am msrah son of thy slave mausrah bin kshardah knight of knights and how quoth she durst thou enter my presence without leave quoth he o my lady when i came to the gate none forbade me neither chamberlain nor porter but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont although when others come they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them but this is not a time for long talking when the king is expecting our return with this prince the scorpion stingfn199 of the islamitic host that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came without the bane of battling with them these words be ill words rejoined the princess and dame zat aldawahi lied avouching an idle thing and a vain whereof she weeteth not the truth for by the virtue of the messiah this man who is with me is not sharrkan nor is he a captive but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality and i made him my guest so even were we assured that this be sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt i say it would ill befit mine honour that i should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection so make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men but return to the king my father and kiss the ground before him and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the lady zat aldawahi o abrzah replied masurah the knight i cannot return to the king's majesty without his debtor and enemy quoth she and indeed she had waxed very wroth out on thee return to him with my answer and no blame shall befal thee quoth masurah i will not return without him thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed exceed not in talk and vain words for verily this man had not come in to us were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders and if i said to him 'thou art sharrkan son of king omar bin alnu'uman' he would answer 'yes' but 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him for if you do so he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place behold here he is by my side and i will bring him before you sword and targe in hand albeit i were safe from thy wrath answered masurah the knight i am not safe from that of thy father and when i see him i shall sign to the knights to take him captive and we will carry him to the king bound and in abject sort when she heard this she said the matter shall not pass thus for 'twould be blazoning mere folly this man is but one and ye are an hundred knights so if you would attack him come out against him one after one that it may appear to the king which is the valiant amongst youand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fiftieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that princess abrizah said to the knight this man is but one and ye are an hundred so if ye would attack him come out against him one after one that it may appear to the king which is the valiant quoth masurah the knight by the truth of the messiah thou sayest sooth and none but i shall sally out against him first quoth she wait till i go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make if he consent 'tis well but if he refuse ye shall on no wise come to him for i and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom so she went to sharrkan and told him the news whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the emirs but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad till the report reached the king against her wish and intent so he again began reproaching himself and said how came i to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the greeks but hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her indeed their onset one after one would be overburdensome to them will they not come out against me ten by ten that would be villainy said she let one have at one when he heard this he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear and masurah the knight also sprang up and bore down upon him sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cutfn200 which clove him to the middle and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels when the lady beheld that swashingblow sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness so she turned to the knights and said take wreak for your chief thereupon out came the slain man's brother a fierce and furious knight and rushed upon sharrkan who delayed not but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals then cried the princess o ye servants of the messiah avenge your comrade so they ceased not charging down upon him one after one and sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade till he had slain fifty knights the lady looking on the while and allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello but fell upon him in a body and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sledfn201 till he had driven sense and soul out of them then the princess called aloud to her damsels saying who is left in the convent and they replied none but the gate keepers whereupon she went up to sharrkan and took him to her bosom he doing the same and they returned to the palace after he had made an end of the melee now there remained a few of the knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery and when the princess saw this she rose from sharrkan's side and left him for a while but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine indian scymitar and she said now by the truth of the messiah i will not be a niggard of myself for my guest nor will i abandon him though for this i abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the greeks then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the knights and other twenty had taken to flightfn202 when she saw what work he had made with them she said to him allah bless thee o sharrkan the cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets

how oft in the mellay i've cleft the array  and given their
             bravest to lions a prey
ask of me and of them when i proved me prow  o'er creation on
             days of the foray and fray
when i left in the onslaught their lions to lie  on the sands of
             the low landsfn203 in fieriest day

when he ended his verse the princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her o lady mine wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand to guard thee against these caitiffsfn204 she replied then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them how came ye to admit the king's knights into my dwelling without leave of me and they answered o princess it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the king's messengers and especially for the chief of his knights quoth she i think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest and bade sharrkan smite their necks he did so and she cried to the rest of her servants of a truth they deserved even more than that then turning to sharrkan she said to him now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed thou shalt be made acquainted with my history know then that i am the daughter of king hardub of roum my name is abrizah and the ancient dame yclept zat aldawahi is my grandmother by the sword side she it certainly is who told my father of thee and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that i have separated myself from the nazarenes and have become no better than i should be with the moslems wherefore it were wiser that i leave this dwelling while zat aldawahi is on my track but i require of thee the like kindness and courtesy i have shown thee for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account so do not thou neglect to do aught that i shall say to thee remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee hearing her words sharrkan joyed greatly his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight and he said by allah none shall come at thee while life is in my bosom but hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people even so she answered and sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth then said she now is my heart at ease but there remaineth one other condition for thee what is it asked he and she answered it is that thou return with thy host to thine own country quoth he o lady mine my father king omar bin al nu'uman sent me to wage war upon thy sire on account of the treasure he plundered from the king of constantinople and amongst the rest three great jewels noted givers of good fortune quoth she cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes i will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the king of constantinople know that we have a yearly festival highs the convent feast whereat kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families and the visitors abide there seven days i was wont to be one of them but when there befel enmity between us my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years one year it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron as was their custom came a daughter of the king of constantinople a beautiful girl called sophia they tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their waysfn205 but sophia said 'i will not return to constantinople save by water' so they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite and making sail they put out to sea but as they were voyaging behold a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till as fate and fortune would have it she fell in with a nazarene craft from the camphor islandfn206 carrying a crew of five hundred armed franks who had been cruising about a long time when they sighted the sails of the ship wherein sophia and her women were they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and splitting their sails drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast thereupon we sallied forth and looking on them as spoil driven to us by fatefn207 boarded and took them and slaying the men made prize of the wreck wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens amongst whom was the king's daughter sophia after the capture we carried the princess and her women to my father not knowing her to be a daughter of king afridun of constantinople and he chose out for himself ten including her and divided the rest among his dependents presently he set apart five damsels amongst whom was the king s daughter and sent them to thy father king omar bin alnu'uman together with other gifts such as broadclothfn208 and woollen stuffs and grecian silks thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls sophia daughter of king afridun nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat rebuking him with menaces and saying to him two years ago you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of frankish pirates in which was my daughter sophia attended by her maidens numbering some threescore yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise nor could i make the matter public lest reproach befal me amongst the kings by reason of my daughter's honour so i concealed my case till this year when i wrote to certain frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the kings of the isles they replied 'by allah we carried her not forth of thy realm but we have heard that king hardub rescued her from certain pirates and they told me the whole tale' then he added in the writing which he writ to my father 'except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter you will the instant my letter reacheth you send my daughter back to me but if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment i will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices'fn209 when my father read this letter and understood the contentsfn210 it vexed him and he regretted not having known that sophia king afridun's daughter was among the captured damsels that he might have sent her back to her sire and he was perplexed about the case because after so long a time he could not send to king omar bin alnu'uman and demand her back from him especially as he had lately heard that heaven had granted him boon of babe by this sophia so when we pondered that truth we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to king afridun making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to king omar bin al nu'uman who had gotten the blessing of issue by her when my father's reply reached king afridun he rose up and sat downfn211 and roared and foamed at the mouth crying'what shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to kings and they lie with her without marriage contract by the messiah and the true faith' said he 'i will not desist till i have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame and indeed i will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me' so he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares when he sent an embassy to thy father king omar to tell him that which thou hast heard accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to king afridun whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot as for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid there was not one soothfast word in that matter for they were with sophia his daughter and my father took them from her when he got possession of her and of her maidens and gave them to me in free gift and they are now with me so go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into and shut in by the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the franks and the country of the greeks for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the day of retribution and retaliation i know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them because thou didst order a three days' rest withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do when sharrkan heard her words he was absent awhile in thought then he kissed princess abrizah's hand and said praise be to allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me but 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and i know not what will become of thee after my departure go now to thine army she replied and turn them back while ye are yet near your own country if the envoys be still with them lay hands on them and keep them that the case may be made manifest to you and after three days i will be with you all and we will enter baghdad together as he turned to depart she said forget not the compact which is between me and thee then she rose to bidfn212 him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire so she took leave of him and throwing her arms round his neck wept with exceeding weeping and repeated these verses

i bade adieu my right hand wiped my tears away  the while my
             left hand held her in a close embrace
'fearest thou naught' quoth she 'of shame' i answered 'nay 
             the lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace'

then sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent they brought his steed so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow as soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert and he bared his brand and rode cautiously but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold it was the wazir dandan and two of his emirs when they saw him and knew him they dismounted and saluting him asked the reason of his absence whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and princess abrizah from first to last the wazir returned thanks to almighty allah for his safety and saidfn213 let us at once leave these lands for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the king of our approach and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners so sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount which they did and setting out at once they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay the ambassadors meanwhile had reported sharrkan's approach to their king who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him but sharrkan escorted by the wazir dandan and the two emirs had no sooner sighted the army than he raised the cry march march they took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day nor did they cease faring for five days at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley where they rested awhile then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country here deeming themselves safe they halted to rest and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts they tarried there two days after which as all would be making for their homes sharrkan put the wazir dandan in command bidding him lead the host back to baghdad but he himself remained behind with an hundred riders till the rest of the army had made one day's march then he called to horse and mounted with his hundred men they rode on two parasangs'fn214 space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust so they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers lion faced and in mail coats cased as soon as they drew within earshot of sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them saying by the virtue of john and mary we have won to our wish we have been following you by forced marches night and day till we forewent you to this place so dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves that we may grant you your lives when sharrkan heard this his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'how is it o nazarene dogs ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land and doth not this suffice you but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country then he shouted to his hundred horsemen up and at these hounds for they even you in number so saying he bared his sabre and bore down on them he and his but the franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks and wight dashed against wight and knight dashed upon knight and hot waxed the fight and sore was the affright and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight and they stinted not to charge and to smite right hand meeting right nor to hack and hew with blades bright white till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight then they drew apart and sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only who showed hurts but not death hurts said he to them by allah my life long have i waded in the clashing sea of fight and i have met many a gallant sprite but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant knights know o king said they that there is among them a frankish cavalier who is their leader and indeed he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust but by allah he spares us great and small for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him by allah had he willed he had killed us all sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the knight had done and such high report of him so he said when the morn shall morrow we will draw out and defy them for we are an hundred to their hundred and we will seek aid against them from the lord of the heavens so they rested that night in such intent whilst the franks gathered round their captain and said verily this day we did not win our will of these and he replied at early dawn when the morrow shall morn we will draw out and challenge them one after one they also rested in that mind and both camps kept guard until almighty allah sent the light of day dawn thereupon king sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain where they found the franks ranged in line of battle and sharrkan said to his followers our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir so up and at them and lay on load then came forth an herald of the franks and cried out saying let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day save by the duello a champion of yours against a champion of ours whereupon one of sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying ho who is for smiting let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling hardly had he made an end of his vaunt when there sallied forth to him a frankish cavalier armed cappie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff riding on a grey white steedfn215 and he had no hair on his cheeks he urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust but it was not long before the frank foined the moslem with the lance point and toppling him from his steed took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen his folk rejoiced in their comrade and forbidding him to go out again to the field sent forth another to whom sallied out another moslem brother to the captive and offered him battle the two fell to either against other and fought for a little while till the frank bore down upon the moslem and falsing him with a feint tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner after this fashion the moslems ceased not dashing forwards one after one and the franks to unhorse them and take them captive till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted now they had captured of the moslems twenty cavaliers and when sharrken saw this it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them what is this thing that hath befallen us to morrow i myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band if he persist we will punish him with death and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him they righted on this wise till allah almighty caused the morn to dawn when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain and sharrkan was going forth to the plain but behold more than one half of the franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted till they reached the midst of the battle plain sharrken looked at that horseman and lo he was their chief he was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks he hent in hand an indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow like a dirham and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when signing to the moslems he cried out in fluent arab speech ho sharrkan ho son of omar bin al nu'uman ho thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries up and out to battle bout and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field thou art prince of thy people and i am prince of mine and whoso overcometh his adversary him let the other's men obey and come under his sway hardly had he ended his speech when out came sharrkan with a heart full of fury and urging his steed into the midst of the field closed like a raging lion with the frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors then they fell to foining and hewing and they stinted not of onset and offset and give and take as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened then they drew apart and each returned to his own party but as soon as sharrkan foregathered with his comrades he said never looked i on the like of this cavalier he hath one quality i have not yet seen in any and this it is that when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lanceheel in very deed i know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men then he went to his rest for the night and when morning dawned the frank came forth and rode down to the mid field where sharrkan met him and they fell to fighting and to wheeling left and right and necks were stretched out to see the sight nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello and at last the frank said to his men tomorrow shall decide the matter so they both passed that night restfully till dawn and as soon as it was day they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done then the frank bethought him of a ruse first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein so that he stumbled and fell with his rider thereupon sharrkan threw himself on the foe and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged when the frank cried out to him o sharrkan champions are not wont to do thus this is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a womanfn216 when sharrkan heard this he raised his eyes to the frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him recognized in him princess abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent whereupon he cast brand from hand and kissing the earth before her asked her what moved thee to a deed like this and she answered i desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting these that are with me are my handmaids and they are all clean maids yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain and had not my steed stumbled with me thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat sharrkan smiled at her speech and said praise be to allah for safety and for my reunion with thee o queen of the age then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of sharrkan's troop and dismount they did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and sharrkan who said to them it is the like of you that kings keep in store for the need hour then he signed to his comrades to salute the princess so all alighted and kissed the earth before her for they knew the story after this the whole two hundred took horse and fared on night and day for six days' space till they drew near to baghdad when they halted and sharrkan bade abrizah and her handmaids doff the frankish garb that was on themand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan bade princess abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of greece and thus did they then he despatched a company of his companions to baghdad to acquaint his father omar bin alnu'uman with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by princess abrizah daughter of king hardub lord of graecialand they halted forthright in the place they had reached and sharrkan also halted and all righted there and when almighty allah made morning dawn sharrkan and his company and abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city when lo on the way they met the wazir dandan who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour abrizah and sharrkan by especial commandment of king omar son of al nu'uman when the two drew near they turned towards them and kissed ground before them then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace sharrkan walked in to his father who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case so he told him all that abrizah had told him and what had passed between them and said she hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us and indeed he said to his father the king of constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief because of his daughter sophia for that the king of greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee and he the grecian king not knowing her to be daughter of king afridun lord of constantinople and had he known that he would not have bestowed her upon thee but he would have restored her to her parent and of a verity he continued we were saved from these perils only by the lady abrizah and never saw we a more valiant than she and he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting when king omar heard the story of sharrkan abrizah was exalted in his eyes and he longed to see her and question her thereupon sharrkan went out to her and said the king calleth for thee she replied i hear and i obey and he took her and brought her in to his father who was seated on his throne and who having dismissed his high officers was attended only by his eunuchs the princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands saluted him in choice terms he was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son sharrkan and bade her be seated so she sat down and unveiled her facefn217 and when the king saw her beauty his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels and assigning them solde and allowances then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid and she answered here be they with me o king of the age so saying she rose and going to her lodging unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold she opened the casket and taking out those three jewels kissed them and gave them to the king then she went away bearing his heart with her after her going the king sent for his son sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three and when he enquired of the other two replied o my son i mean to give one to thy brother zau almakan and the other to thy sister nuzhat al zaman but when sharrkan heard that he had a brother for to that time he knew only of his sister he turned to his sire and said to him o king hast thou a son other than myself he answered yes and he is now six years old adding that his name was zau al makan and that he and nuzhat alzaman were twins born at a birth this news was grievous to sharrkan but he kept his secret and said the bless ing of allah most high be upon them and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes quoth the king how do i see thee change thy manner when hearing of this considering that after me thou becomes heir of the kingdom of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the emirs and grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee and this one of the three jewels is thine sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath and stayed not walking till he had entered abrizah's palace as he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire then she sat down and seated him by her side but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him whereupon he told her that allah had blessed his father with two children by sophia a boy and a girl and that he had named the boy zau almakan and the girl nuzhat alzaman adding he hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine so i left it behind i knew naught of zau almakan's birth till this day and the twain are now six years old so when i learnt this wrath possessed me and i tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee but now i fear lest my father take thee to wife for he loveth thee and i saw in him signs of desire for thee so what wilt thou say if he wish this quoth she know o sharrkan that thy father hath no dominion over me nor can he have me without my consent and if he prevail over me by force i will take my own life as for the three jewels it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and i had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price but now i desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee if thou have accepted it hearkening and obedience replied sharrkan and gave it to her then said she fear nothing and talked with him awhile and continued i fear lest my father hear that i am with you and sit not patiently under my loss but do his endeavours to find me and to that end he may ally himself with king afridun on account of his daughter sophia and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil when sharrken heard these words he said to her o my lady if it please thee to sojourn with us take no thought of them though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea  'tis well rejoined she if ye entreat me fair i will tarry with you and if ye deal evilly by me i will depart from you then she bade her slave maidens bring food so they set the tables and sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house disturbed and perturbed such was his case but regarding the affairs of his father omar bin alnu'uman after dismissing his son sharrkan he arose and taking the other two jewels betook himself to the lady sophia who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated presently his two children zau almakan and nuzhat alzaman came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands then went they to their mother who joyed in their joy and wished the king long life so he asked her why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of king afridun lord of constantinople that i might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank o king answered sophia and what could i desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee overwhelmed as i am with thy favours and thy benefits and furthermore allah hath blessed me with two children by thee a son and a daughter her reply pleased the king and after leaving her he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace moreover he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment and presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his court where he distributed justice among the lieges so far concerning him and sophia and her children but in the matter of abrizah the king was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day and every night he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her but she gave him no answer only saying o king of the age i have no desire for men at this present when he saw her withdraw from him his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until when weary of this he summoned his wazir dandan and opening his very heart to him told him of his love for princess abrizah daughter of hardub and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die for that he could get no grace of her the wazir hearing these words said to the king as soon as it is dark night take thou a piece of bhang the measure of a miskal about an ounce and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her when the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near fill her a last cup and dropping therein the bhang give it to her to drink and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her and such is my advicefn218 thy rede is aright quoth the king and seeking his treasury he took thence a piece of concentrated bhang if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year this he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by when he betook himself to the palace of princess abrizah who seeing him stood up to receive him but he bade her sit down so she sat down and he sat by her and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail whereupon she furnished the carousing tablefn219 and placed it before him then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking so they fell to tippling and the king ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head and seeing this he took out the bit of bhang from his pocket and holding it between his fingers filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off then filling a second he said to thy companionship and dropped the drug into her cup she knowing naught of it she took it and drank it off then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber he waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs when the king saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and satan seduced him and he could not master himself but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head then he rose off her and went to one of her women by name marjnah and said go in to thy lady and speak with her so she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible with the blood running down to the calves of her legs whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night as soon as almighty allah brought the dawn the handmaid marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of bhang like a bolusfn220 then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to marjanah tell me what hath befallen me so she told her what had passed and how she had found her lying on her back with the blood running down wherefore she knew that king omar bin alnu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her at this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy saying to her damsels deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that i am ill till i see what allah will do with me presently the news of her sickness came to the king so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries some months she thus passed in solitude during which time the king's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched so that he abstained from her now she had conceived by him and when the months of child breeding had gone by her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled and the world was straitened upon her so she said to her handmaid marjanah know that it is not the folk who have wronged me but i who sinned against my own selffn221 in that i left my father and mother and country indeed i abhor life for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me i used when i mounted my steed to have the mastery of him but now i am unable to ride if i be brought to bed among them i shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame and if i return to my father with what face shall i meet him or with what face shall i have recourse to him how well quoth the poet

'say what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead 
             nor cup companion nor a cup nor place to house his head'

marjanah answered her it is thine to command i will obey and abrizah said i desire at once to leave this place secretly so that none shall know of me but thou and return to my father and my mother for when flesh stinketh there is naught for it but its own folk and allah shall do with me e'en as he will o princess marjanah replied what thou wouldest do is well then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the king went out to chase and hunt and his son sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile then said she to marjanah i wish to set out this night but how shall i do against my destiny for already i feel the pangs of labour and child birth and if i abide other four or five days i shall be brought to bed here and i shall be unable to travel to my country but this is what was written on my forehead then she considered awhile and said to marjanah look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way for i have no strength to bear arms by allah o my lady replied marjanah i know none but a black slave called al ghazbnfn222 who is one of the slaves of king omar bin al nu'uman he is a valiant wight and he keepeth guard at our palace gate the king appointed him to attend us and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours so lookye i will go out and speak with him of this matter and promise him some monies and tell him that if he have a mind to tarry with us i will marry him to whom he will he told me before to day that he had been a highwayman so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land she rejoined call him that i may talk with him whereupon marjanah fared forth and said to the slave 'o ghazban allah prosper thee so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee then she took him by the hand and brought him to the princess whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him her heart took fright at him how ever she said to herself of a truth need giveth the law and she approached to speak with him yet her heart started away from him presently she said o ghazban say me wilt thou help me against the perfidies of fortune and conceal my secret if i discover it to thee when the slave saw her his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply o my mistress whatsoever thou biddest me do i will not depart therefrom quoth she i would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the king's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt and go with us to our own country where if thou desire to abide with us i will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens or if thou prefer return to thine own land we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee when al ghazban heard this he rejoiced with great joy and replied o my lady i will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses then he went away gladsome and saying to himself i shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me i will kill them both and take their riches but he kept this his intent to himself and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses one of which he rode and princess abrizah made marjanah mount the second she mounting the third albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish and the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country when the travail pangs came upon abrizah and she could no longer resist so she said to alghazban set me down for the pains of labour are upon me and cried to marjanah do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me then marjanah dismounted from her horse and alghazban did in like sort and they made fast the bridles and helped the princess to dismount for she was aswoon from excess of anguish when alghazban saw her on the ground satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face said o my lady vouchsafe me thy favours hearing these words she turned to him and said it remaineth for me only that i yield me to negro slaves after having refused kings and bravesand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fiftysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that princess abrizah said to the black slave al ghazban it remaineth for me only that i yield me to negro slaves after having refused kings and braves and she was wroth with him and cried woe to thee what words are these thou sayest out on thee and talk not thus in my presence and know that i will never consent to what thou sayest though i drink the cup of death wait till i have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth and then if thou be able thereto do with me as thou wilt but an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly i will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this and she began reciting extemporefn223

o spare me thou ghazban indeed enow for me  are heavy strokes
            of time mischance and misery
whoredom my lord forfends to all humanity  quoth he 'who
           breaks my bidding hell for home shall see'
and if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way  against th'
          almighty's choicest gift my chastity
upon my tribesmen i with might and main will call  and gather
          all however far or near they be
and with yamni blade were i in pieces hewn  ne'er shall he
           sight my face who makes for villeiny
the face of free born come of noble folk and brave  what then
            can be to me the seed of whoreson slave

when ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty greyfn224 his nostrils swelled his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled and he repeated these couplets

ho thou abrizah mercy leave me not for i  of thy love and
             yamnifn225 glance the victim lie
my heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty  my body wasted and my
                   patience done to die
from glances ravishing all hearts with witchery  reason far
           flies the while desire to thee draws nigh
though at thy call should armies fill the face of earth  e'en
           now i'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy

when abrizah heard these words she wept with sore weeping and said to him woe to thee o ghazban how dareth the like of thee to address me such demand o base born and obscene bred dost thou deem all folk are alike when the vile slave heard this from her he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains such was the case with alghazban but as regards abrizah she gave birth to a son like the moon and marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side and lo and behold the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dyingfn226 when marjanah saw this she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed saying alas my mistress alas the pity of it thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave after all thy knightly prowess and she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizonfn227 but after awhile it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host now this was the army of king hardub princess abrizah's father and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to baghdad and that they were with king omar bin al nu'uman he had come forth leading those with him to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the king when he had gone a single day's march from his capital he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and marjanah and the slave al ghazban and he made for them to push inquiry seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself so he killed abrizah and fled for his life when they came up king hardub saw his daughter lying dead and marjanah weeping over her and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground all the riders of his company the emirs and waxirs took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the king a great pavilion domed and circular without which stood the grandees of the realm when marjanah saw her master she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled and when he came to himself he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to king omar bin alnu'uman and she informed him how sharrkan's father had dealt with the princess when king hardub heard this the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping then he called for a litter and therein laying his dead daughter returned to caesarea and carried her into the palace where he went in to his mother zat aldawahi and said to that lady of calamities shall the moslems deal thus with my girl verily king omar bin alnu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force and after this one of his black slaves slew her by the truth of the messiah i will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame else will i kill myself with mine own hand and he wept passing sore quoth his mother none other than marjanah killed thy daughter for she hated her in secret and she continued to her son fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter for by the truth of the messiah i will not turn back from king omar bin alnu'uman till i have slain him and his sons and of a very truth i will do with him a deed passing the power of sage and knight whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place but needs must thou do my bidding in all i shall direct for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire by the virtue of the messiah replied he i will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say then quoth she bring me a number of hand maids high bosomed virgins and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before kings and the art of conversation and making verses and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge and the sages must be moslems that they may teach them the language and traditions of the arabs together with the history of the caliphs and the ancient annals of the kings of alislam and if we persevere in this for four years' space we shall gain our case so possess thy soul in patience and wait for one of the arabs saith 'if we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye' when we have taught the girls these things we shall be able to work our will with our foe for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter she that hath found mercyfn228 as soon as i have made an end of their education as described to thee i will take them and set out with them in person when king hardub heard his mother's words he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him moslem sages they obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought when these came into presence he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels then he committed the handmaidens to their handsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of king hardub he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge philosophy and polite accomplishments and they set themselves to do his bidding such was the case with king hardub but as for king omar bin al nu'uman when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace he sought princess abrizah but found her not nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her this was grievous to him and he said how could the lady leave the palace unknown of any had my kingdom been at stake in this case it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it i will never again go to sport and hunt till i have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them and he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of princess abrizah hereupon behold his son sharrkan returned from his journey and the father told him what had happened and informed him how the lady had fled whilst he was chasing and hunting whereat he grieved with exceeding grief then king omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them appointing for them stipends when sharrkan saw this he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter so one day his father said to him why do i see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face o my father replied sharrkan every time i see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them jealousy seizeth on me and i fear lest it grow on me till i slay them and thou slay me in return and this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion but now i crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest that i may abide there the remnant of my life for as the sayer of bywords saith 'absence from my friend is better and fitter for me' and 'whatso eye doth not perceive that garreth not heart to grieve' and he bowed his head towards the ground when king omar bin alnu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down he soothed his heart and said to him o my son i grant thee this and i have not in my reign a greater than the castle of damascus and the government of it is thine from this time thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of damascus of syria and when they had written it he equipped him and sent with him the wazir dandan and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations and took leave of him and the grandees and officers of state did likewise and he set out with his host when he arrived at damascus the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank and the others to the left thus far concerning sharrkan but as regards his father omar bin al nu'uman soon after the departure of his son the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him o our lord thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony the king rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men seeing zau al makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship the prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers loving the poor the olema and the koran students so that all the people of baghdad loved him men and women one day the procession of the mahmilfn229 of irk passed round baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to meccah and visitation of the tomb of the prophet whom allah bless and preserve when zau almakan the mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrimfn230 so he went in to his sire and said i come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage but his father forbade him saying wait till next year and i will go and thou too when the prince saw that the matter was postponed he betook himself to his sister nuzhat alzaman whom he found standing at prayer as soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her i am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the holy house of allah at meccah and to visit the tomb of the prophet upon whom be peace i asked my father's leave but he forbade me that so i mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge allah upon thee exclaimed she take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the prophet whom allah bless and keep and he answered as soon as it is dark night do thou come forth from this place without telling any accordinglywhen it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit and she ceased not walking to the palace gate where she found zau almakan with camels ready for marching so he mounted and mounted her and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the irakifn231 pilgrimparty and they ceased not marching and allah wrote safety for them till they entered meccah the holy and stood upon araft and performed the pilgrimage rites then they made a visitation to the tomb of the prophet whom allah bless and assain and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land but zau almakan said to his sister o my sister it is in my mind to visit the holy housefn232 jerusalem and abraham the friend of allahfn233 on whom be peace i also desire so to do replied she so they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of jerusalem palmers that very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill and was grievously ill but presently recovered after which the brother also sickened she tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at jerusalem but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker they alighted at a khan and there hired a lodging but zau al makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious at this his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this is the decree of allah they sojourned in that place awhile his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left then she sent a servant of the khan to the bazar with some of her clothes and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had piece by piece till nothing was left but an old rug whereupon she wept and exclaimed verily is allah the orderer of the past and the future presently her brother said to her o my sister i feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat by allah o my brother replied she i have no face to beg but tomorrow i will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living then she bethought herself awhile and said of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state but i must despite myself he rejoined allah forbid thou wilt be put to shame but there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah and he wept and she wept too then she said o my brother we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year but none hath yet knocked at our door shall we then die of hunger i know no resource but that i go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive till thou recover from thy sickness when we will travel back to our native land she sat weeping awhile and he wept too propped upon his elbow then nuzhat alzaman arose and veiling her head with a bit of camletfn234 which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him weeping and knowing not whither she should wend and she stinted not going and her brother zau almakan awaiting her return till the supper time but she came not and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not and this endured till two days went by he was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her and hunger was sore upon him at last he left the chamber and calling the servant of the caravanserai said i wish thee to bear me to the bazar so he carried him to the market street and laid him down there and the people of jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition he signed to them begging for somewhat to eat so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar and bought food and fed him therewith after which they carried him to a shop where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head when night fell all the folk went away sore concerned for him and in the middle of the night he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams and hiring a camel said to the driver carry this sick man to damascus and leave him in the hospital haply he may be cured and recover health on my head be it replied the camel man but he said to himself how shall i take this sick man to damascus and he nigh upon death so he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a hammam and went his way when morning dawned the stokerfn235 of the bath came to his work and finding zau almakan cast on his back exclaimed why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here so saying he gave him a kick and he moved whereupon quoth the fireman some one of you who hath eaten a bit of hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land and he cried there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah verily i have sinned against this youth for indeed the prophet whom allah bless and keep enjoineth honour to the stranger more especially when the stranger is sick then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him so she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face meanwhile the stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar and sprinkled zau almakan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him with this zau almakan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him and he sat up and leant against the pillow hereat the fireman rejoiced and exclaimed praise be to allah for the welfare of this youth o allah i beseech thee by thy knowledge of hidden things that thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my handsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fiftyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the fireman exclaimed o allah i beseech thee of thy knowledge of hidden things that thou make this young man's life the work of my hands and he ceased not to nurse him for three days giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water and doing him all manner of service and kindness till health began to return to his body and zau almakan opened his eyes presently came in the fireman and seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment said to him what is now thy state o my son praise be to allah replied zau almakan i am well and like to recover if such be the will of allah almighty at this time the stoker praised the lord of all for this and wending fast to the market bought ten chickens which he carried to his wife and said kill two of these for him every day one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day so she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth when he had done eating she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it after which she cut it up and bringing it to zau almakan said eat o my son while he was eating behold her husband entered and seeing her feeding him sat down at his head and said to him how is it with thee now o my son thanks be to allah for recovery he replied may the almighty requite thee thy kindness to me at this the fireman rejoiced and going out bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it now the stoker used to work at the hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams whereof he spent every day for zau almakan one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower waterfn236 and another dirham for fowls and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole thereupon the fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him o my son wilt thou go with me to the bath whereto he answered yes so the stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy and he mounted zau almakan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnaceroom and went forth to the market and bought iote leaves and lupinflourfn237 with which he returned to the bath and said to zau almakan o my master in allah's name walk in and i will wash thy body so they entered the inner room of the bath and the fireman took to rubbing zau almakan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal when there came to them a bathman whom the bath keeper had sent to zau almakan and he seeing the stoker washing and rubbing him said this is doing injury to the keeper's rights replied the fireman the master overwhelmeth us with his favours then the bathman proceeded to shave zau almakan's head after which he and the stoker washed themselves and returned to the house where he clad zau almakan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck meanwhile the fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens so as soon as zau almakan entered and seated himself on the carpet the husband arose and dissolving sugar in willow flower water made him drink of it then he brought the food tray and cutting up the chickens fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied when he washed his hands and praised allah for recovery and said to the fireman thou art he whom the almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure leave this talk replied the other and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me said zau almakan and after i will tell thee my story rejoined the fireman as for that i found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house as i went to my work near the morning and knew not who had thrown thee there so i carried thee home with me and this is all my tale quoth zau almakan glory to him who quickeneth the bones though they be rotten indeed o my brother thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage and he added but where am i now thou art in the city of jerusalem replied the stoker where upon zau almakan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept then he discovered his secret to the fireman and told him his story and began repeating

in love they bore me further than my force would go  and for
            them made me suffer resurrection throe
oh have compassion cruel on this soul of mine  which since
            ye fared is pitied by each envious foe
nor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance  my case to
            lighten easing this excess of woe
quoth i 'heart bear this loss in patience' patience cried 
             'take heed no patience in such plight i'm wont to show' 

then he redoubled his weeping and the fireman said to him weep not but rather praise allah for safety and recovery asked zau almakan how far is it hence to damascus answered the other six days' journey then quoth zau almakan wilt thou send me thither o my lord quoth the stoker how can i allow thee to go alone and thou a youth and a stranger to boot if thou would journey to damascus i am one who will go with thee and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me i will take up my abode there for it is no light matter to part with thee then said he to his wife wilt thou travel with me to damascus of syria or wilt thou abide here whilst i lead this my lord thither and return to thee for he is bent upon going to damascus of syria and by allah it is hard to me to part with him and i fear for him from highway men replied she i will go with you both and he rejoined praised be allah for accord and we have said the last word then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gearand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the fire man and his wife agreed with zau almakan to travel with him damascus wards then the stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for zau almakan and they set out and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached damascus and they arrived there towards eventide when the fireman went forth and as was his wont bought some meat and drink they had dwelt but five days in damascus when his wife sickened and after a short illness was translated to the mercy of almighty allah her death was a heavy matter to zau almakan for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously and the fireman grieved for her with excessive grief presently the prince turned to the stoker and finding him mourning said to him grieve not for at this gate we must all go in replied he allah make weal thy lot o my son surely he will compensate us with his favours and cause our mourning to cease what sayst thou o my son about our walking abroad to view damascus and cheer thy spirits replied zau almakan thy will is mine so the fireman arose and placed his hand in that of zau al makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the viceroy of damascus where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs and horses ready saddled and bactrian dromedaries while mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro quoth zau almakan i wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs so he asked one of the eunuchs whither this dispatching'' and he answered these are presents sent by the emir of damascus to king omar bin alnu'uman with the tribute of syria now when zau almakan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears and he began repeating

oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne  ye whose sight
             in my spirit shall ever dwell
your charms are gone but this heart of me  hath no sweet and
             no pleasures its sour dispel
if allah's grace make us meet again  in long drawn lovetale my
             love i'll tell

and when he had ended his verse he wept and the fireman said to him o my son we hardly believed that thy health had returnedfn238 so take heart and do not weep for i fear a relapse for thee and he ceased not comforting and cheering him whilst zau almakan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets

get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way 
           and know how surely death descends thy life lot to waylay
all thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine  all
           thy worldly life is vexing of thy soul in vain display
say is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest  where
           at night he 'nakhs'fn239 his camels and moves off at dawn
           of day

and he continued to weep and wail over his separation whilst the fireman also bewept the loss of his wife yet ceased not to comfort zau almakan till morning dawned when the sun rose he said to him meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land yes replied zau almakan and i can no longer tarry here so i will commend thee to allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them little by little till i come to my mother land said the stoker and i with thee for of a truth i cannot bear to part with thee i have done thee kindly service and i mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel at this zau almakan rejoiced and said allah abundantly requite thee for me and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together the fireman at once went forth and bought another ass selling the camel and laid in his provaunt and said to zau almakan this is for thee to ride by the way and when thou art weary of riding thou canst dismount and walk said zau almakan may allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother then he waited till it was dark night when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey this much befel zau almakan and the fireman but as regards what happened to his sister nuzhat alzaman when she left her brother in the khan where they abode and wrapped in the old camlet went out to seek service with some one that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for she fared on weeping and knowing not whither to go whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land so she implored allah almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying

dark falls the night and passion comes sore pains to gar me
            dree  and pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my
           tormentry
and cease not separation flames my vitals to consume  and
           drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacy
and longing breeds me restlessness desire for ever fires  and
          tears to all proclaim what i would keep in secrecy
no cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure  that i may
            quit this sickly state may cure my malady
the love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel  the
           lover from its hell of fire must bear hell's agonyfn240
o thou who blamest me for all befel me 'tis enough  patient i
           bear what ever wrote the reed of doom for me
by love i swear i'll never be consoled no never more  i swear
             the oath of love's own slaves who know no perjury
o night to chroniclers of love the news of me declare  that
           sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear

then she walked on weeping and turning right and left as she went when behold there espied her an old badawifn241 who had come into the town from the desert with wild arabs other five the old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet and marvelling at her beauty he said to himself this charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger i needs must have her so he followed her little by little till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane and called out to her asking her case and said tell me o my little daughter art thou a free woman or a slave when she heard this she said to him by thy life do not add to my sorrows quoth he allah hath blessed me with six daughters of whom five died and only one is left me the youngest of all and i came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger that i might take thee and carry thee to her to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters if thou have no kith and kin i will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children nuzhat alzaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself haply i may trust myself to this old man then she said to him o nuncle i am a maiden of the arabs and a stranger and i have a sick brother but i will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition which is that i may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother if thou strike this bargain i will fare with thee for i am a stranger and i was high in honour among my tribe and i awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject i came with my brother from the land of alhijaz and i fearless he know not where i am when the badawi heard this he said to himself by allah i have got my desire then he turned to her and replied there shall none be dearer to me than thou i wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall or if thou wilt bring him over to dwell with us and the badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him then he walked on before her and when she followed him he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels now this badawi was a base born churl a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief a rogue in grain past master of plots and chicane he had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when by the decree of the decreer he fell in with this unhappy one and he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of jerusalem and when outside he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries so the badawi mounted a camel having seated nuzhat alzaman behind him and they rode on all night then she knew that the badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long while they journeyed on making for the mountains in fear any should see them now when it was near dawn they dismounted from their dromedaries and the badawi came up to nuzhat alzaman and said to her o city strumpet what is this weeping by allah an thou hold not thy peace i will beat thee to death o thou town filth when she heard this she loathed life and longed for death so she turned to him and said o accursed old man o gray beard of hell how have i trusted thee and thou hast played me false and now thou wouldst torture me when he heard her reply he cried out o lazy baggage dost thou dare to bandy words with me and he stood up to her and beat her with a whip saying an thou hold not thy peace i will kill thee so she was silent awhile then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly next day she turned to the badawi and said to him how couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains and what is thy design with me when he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her o lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent wilt thou bandy words with me and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint then she bowed down over his feet and kissedfn242 them and he left beating her and began reviling her and said by the rights of my bonnetfn243 if i see or hear thee weeping i will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte o thou city filth so she was silent and made him no reply for the beating pained her but sat down with her arms round her knees and bowing her head upon her collar began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour and the beating she had endured and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition and how they were both strangers in a far country which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating

time hath for his wont to upraise and debase  nor is lasting
           condition for human race
in this world each thing hath appointed turn  nor may man
            transgress his determined place
how long these perils and woes ah woe  for a life all woeful
            in parlous case
allah bless not the days which have laid me low  i' the world
            with disgrace after so much grace
my wish is baffled my hopes cast down  and distance forbids me
             to greet his face
o thou who passeth that dear one's door  say for me these
             tears shall flow evermore

when she had finished her verses the badawi came up to her and taking compassion on her bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears then he gave her a barley scone and said i love not one who answereth at times when i am in wrath so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and i will sell thee to a good man like myself who will do well with thee even as i have done yes whatso thou doest is right answered she and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her she ate very little of that barley bread in the middle of the night the badawi gave orders for departureand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the badawi gave the barley scone to nuzhat alzaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself she replied whatso thou doest is right and about midnight when hunger burned herfn244 she ate a very little of that barley bread and the badawi ordered his party to set out so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting nuzhat alzaman behind him then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days till they entered the city of damascus and alighted at the sultan's khan hard by the viceroy's gate now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes so the badawi came up to her and said o thou city filth by the right of my bonnet if thou leave not this weeping i will sell thee to none but a jew then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber and walked off to the bazar and he went round to the merchants who dealt in slave girls and began to parley with them saying i have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill and i sent him to my people about jerusalem that they might tend him till he is cured as for her i want to sell her but after the dog her brother fell sick the separation from him was grievous to her and since then she doth nothing but weep and now i wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say 'thy brother is with me in jerusalem ill' and i will be easy with him about her price then one of the merchants came up to him and asked how old is she he answered she is a virgin just come to marriageable age and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness but from the day i sent her brother to jerusalem her heart hath been yearning for him so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened now when the merchant heard this he set forth with the badawi and said o shaykhfn245 of the arabs i will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness and i will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept i will give thee ready money and if thou accept not i will return her to thee quoth the badawi an thou wilt take her up to the sultan sharrkan son of omar bin alnu'uman lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan and condition me any conditions thou likest for when thou hast brought her before king sharrkan haply she will please him and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot rejoined the merchant it happens that i have just now something to ask from him and it is this that he write me an order upon the office exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father king omar bin alnu'uman so if he take the girl i will weighfn246 thee out her price at once i agree with thee to this condition answered the badawi so they returned together to the place where nuzhat alzaman was and the wild arab stood at the chamber door and called out saying o njiyahfn247 which was the name wherewith he had named her when she heard him she wept and made no answer then he turned to the merchant and said to him there she sitteth go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as i enjoined thee so the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable especially as she knew the arabic tongue and he said to the badawi if she be even as thou saddest i shall get of the sultan what i will for her then he bespake her peace be on thee my little maid how art thou she turned to him and replied this also was registered in the book of destiny then she looked at him and seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face she said to herself i believe this one cometh to buy me and she continued if i hold aloof from him i shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating in any case this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a badawi may be he cometh only to hear me talk so i will give him a fair answer all this while her eyes were fixed on the ground then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice and upon thee be peace o my lord and allah's mercy and his benedictionfn248 this is what is commanded of the prophet whom allah bless and preserve as for thine enquiry how i am if thou wouldst know my case it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe and she held her peace when the merchant heard what she said his fancy took wings for delight in her and turning to the badawi he asked him what is her price for indeed she is noble thereupon the badawi waxed angry and answered thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk why dost thou say that she is noblefn249 while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk i will not sell her to thee when the merchant heard this he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him calm thyself for i will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest and how much wilt thou give me for her enquired the badawi replied the merchant name thy price for her none should name the son save his sire rejoined the badawi none shall name it but thou thyself quoth the merchant to himself this wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head by allah i cannot tell her price for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks and if she can read and write it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser but this badawi does not know her worth then he turned and said to him o shaykh of the arabs i will give thee in ready money clear of the tax and the sultan's dues two hundred gold pieces now when the badawi heard this he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant saying get up and go thy ways by allah wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth i would not sell it to thee and now i will not sell her but will keep her by me to pasture the camels and grind my grist and he cried out to her saying come here thou stinkard i will not sell thee then he turned to the merchant and said to him i used to think thee a man of judgment but by the right of my bonnet if thou begone not from me i will let thee hear what shall not please thee quoth the merchant to himself of a truth this badawi is mad and knoweth not her value and i will say no more to him about her price at the present time for by allah were he a man of sense he would not say 'by the rights of my bonnet' by the almighty she is worth the kingdom of the chosros and i have not her price by me but if he ask even more i will give him what he will though it be all my goods then he turned and said to him o shaykh of the arabs take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee cried the badawi and what hath the baggage to do with clothes by allah this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her with thy leave said the merchant i will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buyingfn250 replied the other up and do what thou wilt and allah keep thy youth examine her outside and inside and if thou wilt strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked quoth the trader allah forfend i will look at naught save her facefn251 then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and lovelinessand shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the fiftyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the merchant went up to nuzhat alzaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness so he sat by her side and asked her o my mistress what is thy name she answered doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day thereupon the merchant enquired hast thou then two names to day's and yesterday's yes replied she my name in the past was nuzhat alzaman the delight of the age but my name at this present is ghussatfn252 alzaman the despight of the age when the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her hast thou not a sick brother ay by allah o my lord i have quoth she but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in jerusalem the merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself verily the badawi spake the truth of her then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him and she thought of all that had happened to her with the badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped and she began reciting

allah where'er thou be his aid impart  to thee who distant
             dwellest in my heart
allah be near thee how so far thou fare  ward off all shifts of
            time all dangers thwart
mine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight  and start my
            tearsah me how fast they start
would heaven i kenned what quarter or what land  homes thee and
           in what house and tribe thou art
a fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose  while drink i
             tear drops for my sole desert
an thou 'joy slumber in those hours when i  peel 'twixt my side
           and couch coals' burning smart
all things were easy save to part from thee  for my sad heart
           this grief is hard to dree

when the merchant heard her verses he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks but she let down her veil over her face saying heaven forbid o my lord''fn253 then the badawi who was sitting at a little distance watching them saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her so he rose and running to her dealt her with a camel's halter he had in his hand such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open and the blood streamed down her cheeks whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly the merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself there is no help for it but that i buy this damsel though at her weight in gold and free her from this tyrant and he began to revile the badawi whilst nazhat al zaman lay in sensible when she came to herself she wiped away the tears and blood from her face and she bound up her head then raising her glance to heaven she besought her lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating

and pity one who erst in honour throve  and now is fallen into
             sore disgrace
she weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears  and asks
            'what cure can meet this fatal case'

when she had ended her verse she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone by the almighty do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not allah the most high if i pass this night in his place i shall kill myself with my own hand save me from him so allah save thee from gehennafire then quoth the merchant to the badawi o shaykh of the arabs this slave is none of thine affair so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt take her quoth the badawi and pay me down her price or i will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dungfn254 said the merchant i will give thee fifty thousand diners for her allah will openfn255 replied the badawi seventy thousand said the merchant allah will open repeated the badawi this is not the capital spent upon her for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces the merchant rejoined thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley but i will say thee one word wherewith if thou be not satisfied i will set the viceroy of damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force the badawi continued say on an hundred thousand quoth the merchant i have sold her to thee at that price answered the badawi i shall be able to buy salt with her the merchant laughed and going to his lodgings brought the money and put it into the hand of the badawi who took it and made off saying to himself needs must i go to jerusalem where haply i shall happen on her brother and i will bring him here and sell him also so he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at jerusalem where he went to the khan and asked for zau almakan but could not find him such was the case with him but for what regards the merchant and nazhat alzaman when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgingsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the trader saved nuzhat alzaman from the badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment he went down with her to the bazar where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag which he set before her saying all is for thee and i ask nothing of thee in return but that when i lead thee to the sultan viceroy of damascus thou acquaint him with the price i paid for thee albeit it was little compared with thy value and if seeing thee he buy thee of me thou tell him how i have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent and a written recommendation wherewith i can repair to his father king omar bin alnu'uman lord of baghdad to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which i traffic when she heard his words she wept and sobbed and the merchant said to her o my lady i observe that every time i mention baghdad thine eyes are tearful is there any one there whom thou lovest if it be a trader or the like tell me for i know all the merchants and so forth there and if thou wouldst send him a message i will bear it for thee replied she by allah i have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like i know none there but king omar bin nu'uman lord of baghdad when the merchant heard her words he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself by allah i have won my wish then he said to her hast thou been shown to him in time past she answered no but i was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and i have high honour with him so if thou wouldst have the king grant thee thy desire give me ink case and paper and i will write thee a letter and when thou reachest the city of baghdad do thou deliver it into the hand of king omar bin alnu'uman and say to him 'thy handmaid nuzhat alzaman would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place and she sendeth thee her salams' and if he ask further of her say that i am now with the viceroy at damascus the merchant wondered at her eloquence and his affection for her increased and he said to her i cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money tell me dost thou know the koran by heart yes answered she and i am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of galen the physician on the canons of hippocrates and i have commented him and i have read the tazkirah and have commented the burhn and i have studied the simples of ibn baytr and i have something to say of the canon of meccah by avicenna i can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy i have read the books of the shfi'fn256 school and the traditions of the prophet and syntax and i can argue with the olema and discourse of all manner learning moreover i am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs and i know thoroughly the spiritual sciencesfn257 and the times appointed for religious duties and i understand all these branches of knowledge then quoth she to the merchant bring me ink case and paper that i write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to baghdad and enable thee to do without passports now when the merchant heard this he cried out brava bravafn258 then o happy he in whose palace thou shalt thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour she took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses

i see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown  say did
           thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone
what makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart  hath
            every lover strength such memories to own
how sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day 
            'tis gone and ere i taste its sweets afar 'tis flown
i pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news  from thee
            to lover wightwi' love so woe begone
complains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn  for parting
             pangs can break not only heart but stone

and when she had ended writing the verses she continued these words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight she tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes verily sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length no helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses

'no ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light  but
             shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might
no lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart  to meet his
             mate but breeds in me redoubled blight
i bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me  ah me how love
             can part man's mortal frame and sprite' 
then her eyes welled over with tears and she wrote also these two couplets

love smote my frame so sore on parting day  that severance
             severed sleep and eyes for aye
i waxt so lean that i am still a man  but for my speaking thou
             wouldst never say

then she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet this cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land the sorrowful hearted woman nuzhat alzaman in fine she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed glory to him who fashioned theeand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the fiftyninth night

she said it reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat alzaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed glory to him who fashioned thee then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food wherewith he fed her after which he carried her to the hammam and said to the bath woman as soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head dress her and send and let me know of it and she replied hearing is obeying meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath and when the tire woman had done washing her she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench then she sent to tell the merchant and nuzhat alzaman went forth to the outer room where she found the tray spread with food and fruit so she ate and the tire woman with her and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath then she slept till the morning and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her when he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners a suit of turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems moreover he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein worth a thousand diners and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby and each ball a bezel of balass the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money when she had put these on the merchant bade her adorn herself and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her but when folk saw her all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed blessed be allah the most excellent creator o lucky the man in whose house the hall be and the trader ceased not walking and she behind him till they entered the palace of sultan sharrkan when he sought an audience and kissing the earth between his hands said o auspicious king i have brought thee a rare gift unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities quoth the king let me see it so the merchant went out and brought her she following him till he made her stand before king sharrkan when he beheld her blood yearned to blood though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called nuzhat al zaman and a brother zau almakan he having been jealous of them because of the succession and such was the cause of his knowing little about them then having placed her before the presence the merchant said o king of the age besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness she is also versed in all learning sacred and profane including the art of government and the abstract sciences quoth the king to the trader take her price according as thou boughtest her and go thy ways i hear and i obey replied the merchant but first write me a patent exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise said the king i will do this but first tell me what price thou paidest for her said the merchant i bought her for an hundred thousand diners and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand when the sultan heard these words he declared i will give thee a higher price than this for her and calling his treasurer said to him pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit thereupon the sultan summoned the four kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said i call you to witness that i free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her so the kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage when the sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse then after paying him his monies sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent exempting him from toll tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honourand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the sixtieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate after paying him his monies and they wrote a perpetual patent exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour then all about him retired and none remained save the kazis and the merchant whereupon said he to the judges i wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader that we ascertain the truth of his assertions they answered there is no evil in that and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet when they learned that she was become the king's wife then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness presently the wives of the emirs and wazirs heard that king sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping and versed in all branches of knowledge that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four kazis to make trial of her how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them so they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was nuzhat al zaman when they came in to her they found the eunuchs standing before her and as soon as she saw the wives of the emirs and wazirs and grandees of the realm coming to call upon her she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy her handmaidens standing behind her and she received them saying ye be welcome the while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations as if she had been brought up with them so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another this damsel is none other than a queen the daughter of a king then they sat down magnifying her worth and said to her o our lady this our city is illumined by thee and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence the kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace and we all are thy handmaids so by allah do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty and she thanked them for this all this while the curtains were let down between nuzhat alzaman and the women with her on the one side and king sharrkan and the four kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other presently king sharrkan called to her and said o queen the glory of thine age this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge even to astrology so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects she replied saying o king to hear is to obeyfn259 the first subjects whereof i will treat are the art of government and the duties of kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners know then o king that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life for none attaineth to religion save through this world because it is the best road to futurity now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people and men's doings are divided into four divisions government commerce husbandry and craftsmanship now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world which world is the road to futurity since allah almighty hath made the world for his servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to allah and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust if folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity all cause of contention would be cut off but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions so they have need of the sultan that he do justice between them and order their affairs and if the king restrain not his folk from one another the strong will drive the weak to the wall hence ardeshirfn260 saith 'religion and kingship be twins' religion is a hidden treasure and the king is its keeper and the divine ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule for know o king that according to the measure of the sultan's good morals even so will be the time as saith the apostle of allah on whom be peace and salvation 'there be two classes who if they be good the people will be good and if they be bad the people will be bad even the olema and the emirs' and it is said by a certain sage 'there be three kinds of kings the king of the faith the king who protecteth things to which reverence is due and the king of his own lusts' the king of the faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith and it behoveth he be the most faithfulfn261 for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the faith and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to divine ordinance but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented because of submission to the decrees of destiny as for the king who protecteth things to be reverenced he upholdeth the things of the faith and of the world and compelleth his folk to follow the divine law and to preserve the rights of humanity and it fitteth him to unite pen and sword for whoso declineth from what pen hath written his feet slip and the king shall rectify his error with the sharp sword and dispread his justice over all mankind as for the king of his own lusts he hath no religion but the following his desire and as he feareth not the wrath of his lord who set him on the throne so his kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition and sages say 'the king hath need of many people but the people have need of but one king' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures that he reduce their discord to concord that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all and know o king that ardeshir styled jamr shadd or the live coal third of the kings of persia conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and for this purpose get for himself four seal rings one for each division the first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written alterna lives the second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies and on it was written building up the third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written plenty the fourth was the seal of the oppressed and on it was written justice and these usages remained valid in persia until the revelation of alislam chosros also wrote his son who was with the army 'be not thou too open handed with thy troops or they will be too rich to need thee'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the sixtyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that chosros wrote his son 'be not thou too open handed with thy troops or they will be too rich to need thee nor be thou niggardly with them or they will murmur against thee give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress' there is a legend that a desert arab came once to the caliph al mansrfn262 and said 'starve thy dog and he shall follow thee' when the caliph heard his words he was enraged with the arab but abu 'labbs of ts said to him 'i fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone the dog would follow him and leave thee alone' thereupon the caliph almansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present and know o king that abd almalik bin marwn wrote to his brother abd alazz when he despatched him to egypt as follows 'pay heed to thy secretaries and thy chamberlains for the secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the chamberlains with matters of official ceremony whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee' omar bin alkhattbfn263 whom allah accept when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts the second that he should not wear fine clothes the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period it is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence and there is no prudence like piety that there is no means of drawing near to god like good morals no measure like good breeding no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the divine favour that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law no science like that of meditation no worship like obeying the divine commends no faith like modesty no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge so guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth and think of death and doom ere it ariseth saith ali whose face allah honour 'beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them consult them not in aughtfn264 but grudge not complaisance to them lest they greed for intrigue' and eke quoth he 'whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed' and there be rules for this which we will mention if it be allah's will and omar whom allah accept saith 'there are three kinds of women firstly the true believing heaven fearing love full and fruit full who helpeth her mate against fate not helping fate against her mate secondly she who loveth her children but no more and lastly she who is a shackle allah setteth on the neck of whom he will' men be also three the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement the wiser who when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight justice is indispensable in all things even slave girls have need of justice and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty their order would fall to piecesfn265 in short for the rest the prince of noble qualities is beneficence cum benevolence and how excellent is the saying of the poet

by open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command  go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee'

and quoth another

'in ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect  and
             truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul
whoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good
             word  on glory's course must ever be the first to gain the
             goal'

and nazhat alzaman discoursed upon the policy of kings till the bystanders said never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this when she heard their words and understood them she said as for the chapter of good breeding it is wide of comprehension being a compend of things perfect now it so happened that one day there came to the caliph mu'wiyahfn266 one of his companions who mentioned the people of irak and the goodness of their wit and the caliph's wife maysn mother of yezd heard his words so when he was gone she said to the caliph 'o prince of the faithful i would thou let some of the people of irak come in and talk to thee that i may hear their discourse' therewith mu'awiyah said to his attendants 'see who is at the door' and they answered 'the banu tamim' 'let them come in' said he so they came in and with them alahnf son of kaysfn267 then quoth mu'awiyah 'enter o abu bahr' and drew a curtain between himself and maysun that she might hear what they said without being seen herself then he said to alahnaf 'o son of the sea draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me' quoth alahnaf 'part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubesfn268 and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues and make the ghusl or complete ablution on friday as an expiation for all between the fridays'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

'i see not happiness lies in gathering gold  the man most pious
is man happiest
in truth the fear of god is best of stores  and god shall make
the pious choicely blest'
then quoth nuzhat alzaman let the king also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter he asked her 'what be they' and she answered when omar bin abd alazzfn 286 succeeded to the caliphate he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold put it into the public treasury so the banu umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister ftimah daughter of marwan and she sent to him saying 'i must needs speak to thee' so she came to him by night and when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down he said to her 'o aunt it is for thee to speak first since thou hast some thing to ask tell me then what thou wouldst with me' replied she 'o commander of the faithful it is thine to speak first for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others' then said omar 'of a verity allah almighty sent mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others and he elected for him those with him and commissioned him as his apostle and took him to himself'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman continued thus said omar 'verily allah commissioned as his apostle mohammed upon whom be the benediction of allah and his salvation for a blessing to some and a bane to others and he elected for him those with him and took him to himself leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink after him abu bakrfn287 the truth teller became caliph and he left the river as it was doing what was pleasing to allah then arose omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like but when othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream and mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets and without ceasing in like manner yezid and the banu marwn such as abd almalik and wald and sulaymnfn288 drew away water from the stream and the main course dried up till rule devolved upon me and now i am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition' when fatimah heard this she said 'i came wishing only to speak and confer with thee but if this be thy word i have nothing to say to thee' then she returned to the ommiades and said to them 'now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with omar bin alkhattab'fn289 and it is also said that when omar was about to die he gathered his children round him and maslamahfn290 bin abd almalik said to him 'o prince of the faithful how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector none can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee' omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied 'o maslamah i have defended them from this sin all the days of my life and shall i make them miserable after my death of a truth my sons are like other men either obedient to almighty allah who will prosper them or disobedient and i will not help them in their disobedience know o maslamah that i was present even as thou when such an one of the sons of marwanwas buried and i fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of allah to whom belong honour and glory this terrified me and made me tremble and i vowed to allah that if ever i came to power i would not do such deeds as the dead man had done i have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and i hope to die in the mercy of my lord' quoth maslamah 'a certain man died and i was present at his burial and when all was over i fell asleep and i saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes he came up to me and said 'o maslamah it is for the like of this that rulers should rule' many are the instances of this kind and quoth one of the men of authority 'i used to milk the ewes in the caliphate of omar bin abd alaziz and one day i met a shepherd among whose sheep i saw a wolf or wolves i thought them to be dogs for i had never before seen wolves so i asked 'what dost thou with these dogs' 'they are not dogs but wolves' answered the shepherd quoth i 'can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them' quoth he 'when the head is whole the body is whole'fn291 omar bin abd alaziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and after praising and glorifying allah almighty said three words as follows 'o folk make clean your inmost hearts that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren and abstain ye from the things of the world know that between us and adam there is no one man alive among the dead dead are abd al malik and those who forewent him and omar also shall die and those who forewent him' asked maslamah 'o commander of the faithful an we set a pillow behind thee wilt thou lean on it a little while' but omar answered 'i fear lest it be a fault about my neck on resurrection day' then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint whereupon fatimah cried out saying 'ho maryam ho muzahimfn292 ho such an one look to this man' and she began to pour water on him weeping till he revived from his swoon and seeing her in tears said to her 'what causeth thee to weep o fatimah' she replied 'o commander of the faithful i saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before almighty allah of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us this is what made me weep' answered he 'enough o fatimah for indeed thou exceedest' then he would have risen but fell down and fatimah strained him to her and said 'thou art to me as my father and my mother o commander of the faithful we cannot speak to thee all of us' then quoth nuzhat alzaman to her brother sharrkan and the four kazis here endeth the second section of the first chapterand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the sixtysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman said to her brother sharrkan and the four kazis here endeth the second section of the first chapter and it so happened that omar bin abd alaziz wrote to the people of the festival at meccah as follows 'i call allah to witness in the holy month in the holy city and on the day of the greater pilgrimagefn293 that i am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you in that i have neither commanded this nor purposed it neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me nor have i compassed any knowledge thereof and i trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man for i shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress and if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the holy book and the traditions of the apostle do authorise obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness' he said also allah accept of him 'i do not wish to be relieved from death because it is the supreme thing for which the true believer is rewarded' quoth one of authority 'i went to the prince of the faithful omarbin abd alaziz who was then caliph and saw before him twelve dirhams which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury so i said to him 'o commander of the faithful thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live an thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house it were well' 'draw near to me' answered he so i drew near to him and he said 'now as for thy saying 'thou beggarest thy children provide for them and for the poor of thy household' it is without reason for allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house and he will be their guardian verily they are like other men he who feareth allah right soon will allah provide for him a happy issue and he that is addicted to sins i will not up hold him in his sin against allah' then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them 'your father is between two things either ye will be well to do and your parent will enter the fire or ye will be poor and your parent will enter paradise and your father's entry into paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to dofn294 so arise and go allah be your helper for to him i commit your affairs' khlid bin safwnfn295 said 'ysuf bin omarfn296 accompanied me to hishm bin abd almalikfn297 and as i met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants he alighted and a tent was pitched for him when the people had taken their seats i came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him and waiting till my eyes met his eyes bespoke him thus 'may allah fulfil his bounty to thee o commander of the faithful i have an admonition for thee which hath come down to us from the history of the kings preceding thee' at this he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me 'bring what thou hast o son of safwan' quoth i 'o commander of the faithful one of the kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time to this very country and said to his companions 'saw ye ever any state like mine and say me hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me' now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to truth upholders of the right and wayfarers in its highway and he said to him 'o king thou askest of a grave matter wilt thou give me leave to answer' 'yes' replied the king and the other said 'dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting' 'it is temporary' replied the king 'how then' rejoined the man 'do i see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned' quoth the king 'whither shall i flee and what must i seek for me' 'that thou abide in thy kingship' replied the other 'or else robe thee in ragsfn298 and apply thyself to obey almighty allah thy lord until thine appointed hour i will come to thee again at daybreak' khalid bin safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold the king had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite for the stress of his exhortation when hishm bin abd almalik heard this he wept till his beard was wet and bidding his rich apparel be put off shut himself up in his palace then the grandees and dependents came to khalid and said 'what is this thou hast done with the commander of the faithful thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life' then quoth nuzhat alzaman addressing herself to sharrkan how many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter of a truth i cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sittingand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman continued speaking to sharrkan know o king that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth i cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but with length of days o king of the age all will be well there said the kazis o king of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world and of our age the unique pearl never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives and they called down blessings on the king and went away then sharrkan turned to his attendants and said begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds so they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands and he commanded the wives of the emirs and wazirs and grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls and the subjects ate till they were satisfied moreover sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of damascus and they were present together with every slave girl of the king and of the notables who knew how to sing and they went up to the palace in one body when the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles right and left from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace and the emirs and wazirs and grandees marched past before king sharrkan whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her but found she needed no adornment meantime king sharrkan went to the hammam and coming out sat down on his seat of estate whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights then sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenheadfn299 and she at once conceived by him and when she announced it he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception on the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father king omar bin alnu'uman saying that he had bought him a damsel who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge moreover he wrote there is no help but that i send her to baghdad to visit my brother zau almakan and my sister nuzhat alzaman i have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me and he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the wazir dandan and all the emirs then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence sharrkan took it and read as follows after the usual bismillah this is from the afflicted distracted man from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban king omar bin al nu'uman to his son sharrkan know that since thy departure from me the place is become contracted upon me so that no longer i have power of patience nor can i keep my secret and the cause thereof is as follows it chanced that when i went forth to hunt and course zau almakan sought my leave to fare hijaz wards but i fearing for him the shifts of fortune forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after my absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole monthand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the sixtyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king omar bin alnu'uman wrote in his letter my absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month and when i returned i found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth when i knew this the wide world narrowed on me o my son but i awaited the return of the caravan hoping that haply they would come back with it accordingly when the palmers appeared i asked concerning the twain but they could give me no news of them so i donned mourning for them being heavy at heart and in sleep i have no part and i am drowned in the tears of my eyes then he wrote in verse

that pair in image quits me not one single hour  whom in my
             heart's most honourable place i keep
sans hope of their return i would not live one hour  without my
             dreams of them i ne'er would stretch me in sleep

the letter went on and after the usual salutations to thee and thine i command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us when sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister then he took the missive and went in with it to nuzhat alzaman who knew not that he was her brother nor he that she was his sister albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter whereupon she sent for sharrkan and seeing him she said to him this is thy daughter name her as thou wilt quoth he it is usual to name children on the seventh day after birthfn300 then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw hung about its neck a jewel which he knew at once for one of those which princess abrizah had brought from the land of the greeks now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well his senses fled and wrath seized on him his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at nuzhat al zaman and said to her whence hadst thou this jewel o slave girl when she heard this from sharrkan she replied i am thy lady and the lady of all in thy palace art thou not ashamed to say to me slave girl i am a queen daughter of king omar bin alnu'uman hearing this he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwardsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit this is how it fared with him but as regards nuzhat al zaman when she heard that voice in the night her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the chief eunuch who said to her what is thy will quoth she arise and bring me him who recited verses but now replied he of a truth i did not hear himand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

and as he ceased his verses he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the fireman rose and covered him when nuzhat alzaman heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home then she wept and cried at the eunuch and said to him woe to thee he who recited the first time hath recited a second time and i heard him hard by by allah an thou fetch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee out but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt if he refuse hand to him this purse of a thousand diners then leave him and return to me and tell me after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is return quickly and linger notand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seventythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that nuzhat al zaman sent the eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said beware how thou come back to me and report i could not find him so the eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents but found none awake all being asleep for weariness till he came to the stoker and saw him sitting up with his head uncovered so he drew near and seizing him by the hand said to him it was thou didst recite the verses the fireman was afeard for his life and replied no by allah o chief of the people it was not i but the eunuch said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zau almakan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and i know him not i only heard some passer by some wayfarer recite verses so do not thou commit sin on me for i am a stranger and come from the holy city of jerusalem and abraham the friend of allah be with you all rise up and fare with me rejoined the eunuch and tell my lady this with thine own mouth for i have seen none awake save thyself quoth the stoker hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where i now am and dost thou not know my station thou wottest none can stir from his place except the watchman seize him so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or some one i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me then he kissed the eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away but the castrato fetched a round and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings as soon as he was gone the stoker arose and aroused zau almakan and said to him come sit up that i may tell thee what hath happened so zau almakan sat up and his companion told him what had passed and he answered let me alone i will take no heed of this and i care for none for i am mine own countryfn313 quoth the stoker why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil if thou fear no one i fear for thee and for my life so allah upon thee recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land indeed i had not deemed thee so ill conditioned dost thou not know that this lady is the wife of the chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her belike she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home and this is the second time she hath sent the eunuch to look for thee however zau almakan paid no heed to the fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets

i fly the carper's injury whose carping sorely vexeth me
he chides and taunts me wotting not  he burns me but more
            grievously
the blamer cries 'he is consoled'  i say 'my own dear
            landfn314 to see'
they ask 'why be that land so dear'  i say 'it taught me in
            love to be'
they ask 'what raised its dignity'  i say 'what made my
            ignomy'
whate'er the bitter cup i drain  far be fro' me that land to
             flee
nor will i bow to those who blame  and for such love would deal
             me shame

hardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion when the eunuch who had heard him from his hiding place at his head came up to him whereupon the fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them then said the eunuch to zau almakan peace be with thee o my lord and on thee be peace replied zau almakan and the mercy of allah and his blessings o my lord continued the eunuchand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seventyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the eunuch said to zau almakan o my lord i have sought thee these several times this night for my mistress biddeth thee to her quoth zau al makan and who be this bitch that seeketh for me allah curse her and curse her husband with herfn315 and he began to revile the eunuch who could make him no answer because his mistress had charged him to do zau almakan no hurt nor bring him save of his own especial free will and if he would not accompany him to give him the thousand diners so the castrato began to speak him fair and say to him o my lord take this purse and go with me we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and return in weal and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news when zau al makan heard this he arose and went with the eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk stepping over them whilst the fireman followed after them from afar and kept his eye upon him and said to himself alas the pity of his youth tomorrow they will hang him and he ceased not following them till he approached their stationfn316 without any observing him then he stood still and said how base it will be of him if he say it was i who bade him recite the verses this was the case of the stoker but as regards what befel zau almakan he ceased not walking with the eunuch till he reached his station and the castrato went in to nuzhat alzaman and said o my lady i have brought thee him whom thou soughtest and he is a youth fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding when she heard this her heart fluttered and she cried let him recite some verses that i may hear him near hand and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land then the eunuch went out to zau almakan and said to him recite what verses thou knowest for my lady is here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition replied he with love and gladness but an thou ask my name it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste i have a story the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown and behold i am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought when nuzhat alzaman heard this she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing and said to the eunuch ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father the castrato asked as she bade him and zau almakan replied yes i have parted from every one i loved but the dearest of all to me was my sister from whom fate hath separated me when nuzhat al zaman heard this she exclaimed allah almighty reunite him with what he lovethand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seventyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when nuzhat alzaman heard his words she said allah reunite him with what he loveth then quoth she to the eunuch tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country the eunuch did so and zau almakan sighed heavily and began repeating these coupletsfn317

is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest  the house
            that hometh hinda be forever blest'
her love all levels man can reck of naught beside  naught or
           before or after can for man have zest
'tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris  that day
           when hinda's footstep on its face is prest
hail to the beauty of our camp the pride of folk  the dearling
           who en' slaves all hearts by her behest
allah on 'time's delight' send large dropped clouds that teem 
           with genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast
and also these

i vow to allah if at home i sight  my sister nuzhat alzamani
           highs
i'll pass the days in joyance and delight  mid bashful minions
             maidens soft and white
to sound of harps in various modes they smite  draining the
            bowl while eyes rain lively light
'neath half closed lids a sipping lips red bright  by stream
            bank flowing through my garden site

when he had finished his verse nuzhat alzaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him as soon as her eyes fell on his face she knew him for certain and cried out o my brother o zau almakan he also looked at her and knew her and cried out o my sister o nuzhat alzaman then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit when the eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover after a while they came to themselves and nuzhat alzaman rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses

time sware my life should fare in woeful waste  forsworn art
           time expiate thy sin in hastefn318
comes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid  to him who brings
           good news rise gird thy waist
i spurned old world tales of eden bliss  till came i
            kausarfn319 on those lips

when zau almakan heard this he pressed his sister to his breast tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these coupletsfn320

long i lamented that we fell apart  while tears repentant
            railed from these eyne
and sware if time unite us twain once more  'severance' shall
            never sound from tongue of mine
joy hath so overwhelmed me that excess  of pleasure from mine
            eyes draws gouts of brine
tears o mine eyes have now become your wont  ye weep for
            pleasure and you weep for pine

they sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee and i will tell thee what happened to me so they entered and zau almaken said do thou begin thy tale accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the khan and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother sharrkan and had sold her to him how he had freed her at the time of buying how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharrkan then quoth she praised be allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that even as we left our father together so together shall we return to him and she added of a truth my brother sharrkan gave me in marriage to this chamberlain that he might carry me to my father and this is what befel me from first to last so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since i left thee thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end and how allah vouchsafed to send the fireman to him and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day she praised the stoker for this and zau almakan added of a truth o my sister this fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son for that he fasted and gave me to eat and he walked whilst he made me ride and i owe my life to him said she allah willing we will requite him for all this according to our power then she called the eunuch who came and kissed zau al makan's hand and she said take thy reward for glad tidings o face of good omen it was thy hand reunited me with my brother so the purse i gave thee and all in it are thine but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me the castrato rejoiced and going in to the chamberlain him to his mistress accordingly he came in to his wife and finding zau almakan with her asked who he was so she told him all that had befallen them both first and last and added know o chamberlain that thou hast married no slave girl far from it thou hast taken to wife the daughter of king omar bin alnu'uman for i am nuzhat al zaman and this is my brother zau almakan when the chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become king omar bin alnu'uman's son in law so he said to himself  'twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some provincefn321 then he went up to zau almakan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride thereupon said nuzhat alzaman we are now near our country and i would be left alone with my brother that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach baghdad for we have been parted a long long time be it as thou biddest replied the chamberlain and going forth from them sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats together with three suits of the costliest for zau almakan then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and nuzhat alzaman said to him bid the eunuch bring me the fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening and let him be forbidden to leave us the chamberlain called the castrato and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girthing his ass and preparing for flight the tears were running adown his cheeks out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from zau almakan and he was saying to himself indeed i warned him for the love of allah but he would not listen to me oh would i knew what is become of him ere he had done speaking the eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him the fireman turned and seeing the eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fearand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seventysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself saying oh would i knew what is become of him ere he had done speaking the castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices i have done him i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages et about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime then the effeminated one cried at him saying who was it recited the verses o liar why didst thou say 'i never repeated these couplets nor do i know who repeated them' when it was thy companion but now i will not leave thee between this place and baghdad and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee quoth the fireman what i feared hath befallen me and he repeated this couplet

'twas as i feared the coming ills discerning  but unto allah we are all returning

then the eunuch cried upon the pages saying take him off the ass so they carried him along with the caravan surrounded by the pages as the white contains the black of the eye and the castrato said to them if a hair of him be lost you will be lost with it and he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him but when the stoker saw himself beset by the pages he despaired of his life and turning to the eunuch said to him o chief i am neither this youth's brother nor am i akin to him nor is he sib to me but i was a fireman in a hammam and found him cast out in his sickness on the dung heap then the caravan fared on and the stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things whilst the eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing but said to him thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses thou and this youth but fear nothing for thy self and kept laughing at him the while to himself whenever the caravan halted they served him with food and he and the castrato ate from one dishfn322 then the eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and after drinking himself gave it to the fireman who drank but all the while his tears never dried out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from zau almakan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood so they both travelled on with the caravan whilst the chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter in attendance on zau almakan and his sister and now gave an eye to the fireman and nuzhat alzaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from baghdad here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts behold there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest nightfn323 thereupon the chamberlain cried out to them stay and your loading delay then mounting with his mamelukes rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud when they drew near suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea with flags and standards drums and kettledrums horsemen and footmen the chamberlain marvelled at this and when the troops saw him there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them five for one whereupon said he to them what is the matter and what are these troops that ye do this with us asked they who art thou and whence comest thou and whither art thou bound and he answered i am the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharrkan son of omar bin alnu'uman lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan and i bring tribute and presents from him to his father in baghdad when the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept saying in very sooth king omar is dead and he died not but of poison so fare ye forwards no harm shall befal you till you join his grand wazir dandan now when the chamberlain heard this he wept sore and exclaimed oh for our disappointment in this our journey then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the wazir dandan who granted an interview and called a halt and causing his pavilion to be pitched sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the chamberlain then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamberlain to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribute of syria the wazir hearing the mention of king omar's name wept and said king omar is dead by poison and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him until they were like to slay one another on this account but the notables and grandees and the four kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharrkan and make him sultan over his father's realm and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zau almakan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nuzhat alzaman highs the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for alhijaz and none wotteth what is become of them when the chamberlain heard this he knew that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures and he grieved with sore grief for the death of king omar albeit he joyed with exceeding joy especially at the arrival of zau almakan for that he would now become sultan of baghdad in his father's steadand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seventyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sharrkan's chamberlain heard of the death of king omar bin al nu'uman he mourned but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother zau almakan who would become sultan of baghdad in his father's stead so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him verily your tale is a wonder of wonders know o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for that his almighty will restoreth to you zau almakan and his sister nuzhat alzaman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o chamberlain tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence so he repeated to him the whole story and told him that nuzhat alzaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of zau almakan from first to last as soon as he had ended his tale the wazir sent for the emirs and wazirs and chief officers and acquainted them with the matter whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance then they gathered in a body and went in to the chamberlain and did their service to him kissing the ground between his hands and the wazir dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour after this the chamberlain held on that day a divan council and he and the wazir sat upon a throne whilst all the emirs and grandees and officers of state took their places before them according to their several ranksfn324 then they melted sugar in rose water and drank after which the emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them so the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting rode onwards preceded by the standards of war when the grandees had finished their conference they took horse and rejoined the host and the chamberlain approached the wazir dandan and said i deem it well to ride on before you and precede you that i may get ready a place for the sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as sultan over the head of his brother sharrkan aright thou reckest answered the wazir then the chamberlain rose up in haste and dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents which he conjured him to accept in similar guise did all the emirs and grandees and officers of state bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him haply thou wilt mention our case to sultan zau almakan and speak to him to continue us in our dignitiesfn325 the chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march whereupon the wazir dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city and they did his bidding then the chamberlain mounted and rode forward full of joy and saying to himself how blessed is this gurney and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes she and her brother zau almakan they made all haste over their wayfare till they reached a place distant a day's journey from baghdad where the chamberlain called a halt for rest and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the sultan zau almakan son of king omar bin alnu'uman while he rode forward with his mamelukes and alighting at a distance from nuzhat alzaman's litter commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence they did so and she gave permission whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother and told them of the death of their father and of zau almakan how the heads of the people had made him king over them in the stead of his sire and he gave them joy of the kingdom they both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed but the chamberlain answered the news rests with the wazir dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host and it only remaineth for thee o king to do what they counsel since they have unanimously chosen thee sultan for if thou do not this they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another sultan haply he will kill thee or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both zau almakan bowed his head awhile and then said i accept this position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharrkan o my son replied the chamberlain thy brother will be sultan of damascus and thou sultan of baghdad so take heart of grace and get ready thy case zau almakan accepted this and the chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a daggerfn326 of state which the wazir dandan had brought with him then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion wherein the sultan might sit to receive the emirs and grandees moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs they did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round after awhile the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of baghdad and khorasan a conquering host like the full tide seaand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the seventyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their sultan they planted a splendid shhmiynahfn327 befitting kings and as they ended their labours behold a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host and presently it appeared that this was the army of baghdad and khorasan preceded by the wazir dandan and in it all rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place now zau almakan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state so the chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot to do him service and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs whilst the chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the shahmiyanah with drawn swords in their hands presently up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the chamberlain went in to zau almakan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them ten by ten the chamberlain acquainted them with the king's commands to which they replied we hear and we obey and all drew up before the pavilion entrance then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of sultan zau almakan whom when they saw they were awed but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good so they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers and they ceased not to enter ten by ten till none was left but the wazir dandan lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau almakan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sire sans peer verily thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the subtle of lere then bade he the chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto so they came and ate and drank moreover the sultan commanded his wazir dandan call a ten days' halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain the wazir obeyed the commands of the sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said this needs must be he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days they did as he bade them and moreover he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the king for service during the space of three days then the wazir went to the sultan and reported all to him and zau almakan waited until nightfall when he went in to his sister nuzhat alzaman and asked her dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not i have no knowledge of the cause she answered and drew a silken curtain before herself whilst zau almakan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the wazir to the presence and when he came said to him i desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire king omar bin alnu'uman know then o king replied dandan that king omar bin al nu'uman when he returned to baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city enquired for thee and thy sister but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the pilgrimage whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings now while we were in attendance upon him one day after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight lo there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee accompanied by five damsels high bosomed virgins like moons endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe and to crown their perfections of comeliness they could read the koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples then that old woman sought audience of the king and he bade admit her whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands i was then sitting by his side and he seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness made her draw near and take seat hard by him and when she had sat down she addressed him and said 'know o king that with me are five damsels whose like no king among the kings possesseth for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection they read the koranand the traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races they stand here between thy hands to do thee service o king of the age and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised 'thy father who hath found mercyfn328 looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him so he said to them let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the seventyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan said unto king zau almakan thy father who hath found mercy glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them 'let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before' thereupon one of them came forward and kissing the ground before him spake as followsfn329 'know o king that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies and observe the divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who if he stray therefrom falleth into perdition for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour and know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting and the right way thereto is the service of allah wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people and swerve not from this canon for the mightier men are in dignity the more their need of prudence and foresight and indeed monarchs need this more than the many for the general cast themselves into affairs without taking thought to the issue thereof be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of allah and know that if an enemy dispute with thee thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him but as for thy friend there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing choose therefore thy friend for thyself after thou hast proved him if he be of the brotherhood of futurityfn330 let him be zealous in observing the externals of the holy law and versed in its inner meaning as far as may be and if he be of the brotherhood of the world let him be free born sincere neither a fool nor a perverse for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him and a liar cannot be a true friend indeed the word siddkfn331 'friend' deriveth from sidk 'truth' that welleth up from the bottom of the heart and how can this be the case when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue and know that the observance of the law profiteth him who practiseth it so love thy brother if he be of this quality and do not cast him off even if thou see in him that which irketh thee for a friend is not i like a wife whom one can divorce and remarry nay his heart is like glass once broken it may not be mended and allah bless him who saith

'ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart  'tis hard to win
             thee back the heart offended
for hearts indeed whence love is alien made  like broken glass

the maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say 'the best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men it is also said 'it behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking allah especially for two favours health and reason' again it is said 'whoso honoureth himself his lust is a light matter to him and he who maketh much of his small troubles allah afflicteth him with the greater he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend he who thinketh well of thee do thou fulfill his thought of thee he who exceedeth in contention sinneth and he who against upright standeth not on ward is not safe from the sword now will i tell thee somewhat of the duties of kazis and judges know o king that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant and mediation is admissible between moslems except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawfulfn332 if thou shalt have done aught during the day of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved thou o kazi shouldst revert to the right for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong then o judge thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to allah be he extolled and exalted and require thou proof of the complainant and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it and if not put the defendant to his oath for this is the ordinance of allah receive thou the testimony of competent moslem witnesses one against other for almighty allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals he himself taking charge of the inner and secret things it behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet whilst suffering from stress of pain or hungerfn333 and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of allah almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people' quoth alzuhrifn334 'there are three things for which if they be found in a kazi he should be deposed namely if he honour the base if he love praise and if he fear dismissal and omar bin abd alaziz once deposed a kazi who asked him 'why hast thou dismissed me it hath reached me' answered omar 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition' it is said also that iskandarfn335 said to his kazi 'i have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding' to his cook he said 'thou art the sultan of my body so look thou tender it as thine own self' to his secretary he said 'thou art the controller of my wit so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me' thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forwardand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan said to zau almakan thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and kissing the ground seven times before the king thy father spake as follows 'the sage lukmnfn336 said to his son 'there be three who are known only in three several cases the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath the brave only in battle and thy friend in time of need' it is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed quoth allah almightyfn337 'assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done and who love to be praised for what they have not done shall escape reckoning of punishment indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty' and he saidfn338 on whom be salvation and salutation 'works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth' he said also 'in the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound and which being unsound the whole is unsound' and this is the heart now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man since it is that which ordereth his whole affair if covetise stir in it desire destroyeth him and if affliction master it anguish slayeth him if anger rage in it danger is hard upon him if it be blest with contentment he is safe from discontent if fear surprise it he is full of mourning and if calamity overtake it affliction betideth him if a man gain the use of wealth peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his lord if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe or if disquietude waste his heart weakness causeth him to fall thus in any case nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next it was asked of a certain sage 'who is the most ill conditioned of men' and he answered 'the man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth and how excellently saith the poet

freest am i of all mankind fro' meddling wight  who seeing
            others err self error ne'er can sight
riches and talents are but loans to creature lent  each wears
            the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite
if by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make  thou shalt go
            wrong and if the door be right go right'

continued the maiden 'as for anecdotes of devotees quoth hisham bin bashar 'i asked omar bin ubayd what is true piety' and he answered 'the apostle of allah to whom be salutation and salvation hath explained it when he sayeth the pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead' and it is related that abu zarrfn339 used to say want is dearer to me than wealth and unheal is dearer to me than health' quoth one of the listeners 'may allah have mercy on abu zarr' for my part i say 'whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of almighty allah should be content with that condition which allah hath chosen for him' quoth one of the companions of the prophet 'ibn abi aufafn340 once prayed with us the dawn prayer when he had done he recited 'o thou enwrapped'fn341 till he came to where allah saith 'when there shall be a trumping on the trumpet' and fell down dead it is said that sabit albanani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes they brought him a man to medicine him who said to him 'i will cure thee provided thou obey my bidding' asked sabit 'in what matter' quoth the leach 'in that thou leave weeping' 'what is the worth of mine eyes' rejoined sabit 'if they do not weep' quoth a man to mohammed bin abdillah 'exhort thou me'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

she continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan said to zau almakan thus spake the second hand maid to the king who hath found mercy omar bin alnu'uman 'quoth a man to mohammed bin abdillah exhort thou me' 'i exhort thee' replied he 'to be a self ruler an abstainer in this world and in the next a greedy slave' 'how so' asked the other and mohammed answered 'the abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come' and quoth ghaus bin abdillah 'there were two brothers among the sons of israel one of whom said to the other 'what be the most perilousfn342 thing thou hast done' replied the brother 'i once came upon a nest of young birds so i took out one and threw it back into the nest but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it this is the most perilous thing i ever did now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done' he rejoined 'when i arise for prayer i am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward' now their father heard these words and exclaimed 'o allah an say they sooth take them to thyself' it was declared by one of the wise men 'verily these were of the most virtuous of children' quoth sa'd bin jubayrfn343 'i was once in company with fuzalah bin 'ubaydand said to him 'exhort thou me replied he 'bear in mind these two necessaries shun syntheismfn344 and harm not any of allah's creatures' and he repeated these two couplets

'be as thou wilt for allah still is bounteous lord  and care
            dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban
to two things only never draw thee nigh nor give  partner to

and how well saith the poet

'an thou of pious works a store neglect  and after death meet
             one who did collect
thou shalt repent thou diddest not as he  nor madest ready as

then the third damsel came forward after the second had with drawn and said 'of a truth the chapter of piety is exceeding wide but i will mention what occurreth to me thereof concerning the pious of old quoth a certain holy man 'i congratulate myself in death though i am not assured of rest therein save that i know death interveneth between a man and his works so i hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works' and ita'a al salami when he had made an end of an exhortation was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore and as they asked him why he did this he answered 'i desire to enter upon a grave matter and it is the standing up before almighty allah to do in accordance with my exhortation' in similar guise zayn alabidnfn345 son of alhusayn was wont to tremble when he rose to pray being asked the cause of this he replied 'know ye not before whom i stand and whom i address' it is said that there lived near sufyn althaurifn346 a blind man who when the month of ramazan came went out with the folk to prayfn347 but remained silent and hung back said sufyan 'on the day of resurrection he shall come with the people of the koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows' quoth sufyan 'were the soul established in the heart as befitteth it would fly away for joy and pining for paradise and for grief and fear of hellfire' it is related also of sufyan althauri that he said 'to look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin' then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth who said 'here am i to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me it is related that bishr barefootfn348 said 'i once heard khlid say 'beware of secret polytheism' i asked 'what may secret polytheism be' and he answered 'when one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurityfn349 come upon him' and one of the sages said 'doing works of weal expiateth what is ill' quoth ibrahimfn350 'i supplicated bishr barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries but he said 'o my son this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one of every hundred five even as the legal alms upon money' said ibrahim 'i thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while i was praying behold bishr was also praying so i stood behind himfn351 making the prayer bow till the mu'ezzin called his call then rose a man of tattered appearance and said o folk beware of a truth which bringeth unweal for there is no harm in a lie bringing wealfn352 and in time of need no choice we heed speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good presently i saw bishr drop a danikfn353 so i picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which i gave him quoth he 'i will not take it' quoth i 'it is perfectly lawful change' but he rejoined 'i cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world' it is related also that bishr barefoot's sister once went to ahmad bin hanbalfn354and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

among the sayings of sufyn althaur with which he admonished ali bin alhasan alsalami was 'be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride be not indebted save to him who is merciful to his debtors and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of allah and in beseeching of allah peace for what remaineth of thy life counsel every true believer when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith and beware of betraying a believer for whoso betrayeth a believer betrayeth allah and his apostle avoid dissensions and litigation and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubtfn372 so shalt thou be at peace enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence so shalt thou be loved of allah adorn thine inner man and allah shall adorn thine outer man accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the moslems draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee so shalt thou be the friend of the prophets let thine affairs both public and private be in allah's charge and fear him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards resurrection and judgement stead between the hands of the lord of dread and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped either for heavens eterne or to the hell fires that burn' thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels now when thy father who hath found mercy heard their discourse he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time and seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore he showed them all favour moreover he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged princess abrizah daughter of the king of greece to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed they abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them and whenever the king visited them he found her absorbed in prayer watching by night and fasting by day whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me 'o wazir verily this old woman is of the pious and awe of her is strong in my heart' now on the eleventh day the king visited her that he might pay her the price of the damsels but she said to him 'o king know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men indeed i seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels be it little or much' now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her 'o my lady and what is their price' whereto she answered 'i will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast watching by night a whole month and abstaining by day all for the love of allah almighty and if thou do this they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please' so the king wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation she was magnified in his eyes and he said 'allah make this pious woman to profit us' then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated and she said to him 'i will help thee with the prayers i pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water' they brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof lastly she covered it with a cloth and sealing it with her signet ring gave it to thy sire saying 'when thou hast fasted the first ten days break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith as for me tomorrow i will go forth to my brethren the invisiblefn373 controuls for i yearn after them and i will return to thee when the first ten days are past thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace then locked the door and put the key in his pocket next day the king fasted and the old woman went her waysand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eightyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan thus continued to zau almakan now when came the day for the sultan's fast the old woman went her ways and after he had accomplished the ten days thereof on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf like no leaf of known tree she went in to thy sire and saluted him and when he saw her he rose to her saying 'welcome o pious lady' 'o king' quoth she 'the invisible controuls salute thee for i told them of thee and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their halwfn374 which is of the sweetmeats of the other world do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day' the king rejoiced at this with great joy and exclaimed 'praised be allah who hath given me brethren of the invisible world' thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour she went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said 'know o king that i told the invisible controuls of the love which is between me and thee and informed them how i had left the maidens with thee and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a king like thee for they were wont when they saw them to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted so i would fain carry them to the invisible controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour and peradventure they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth that thou after completing thy fast mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee to the extent of thy desires' when thy sire heard her words he thanked her for them and said 'except that i fear to cross thee i would not accept the treasure or aught else but when wilt thou set out with them' replied she 'on the seven and twentieth night and i will bring them back to thee at the head of the month by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal by allah each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom' he said 'i know it o pious lady' then quoth the old woman 'there is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the invisible controuls' quoth he 'i have a greek slave called sophia by whom i have been blessed with two children a girl and a boy but they were lost years ago take her with thee that she may get the blessing'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eightysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir dandan continued to zau almakan quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him 'i have a greek slave called sophia by whom i have been blest with two children a girl and a boy but they were lost years ago so take her with thee haply she may get the benediction and belike the invisible controuls will sue allah for her that her two children may be restored to her' 'thou hast said well' replied she 'for that indeed was her grievousest want' thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him 'o my son i am going to the invisible controuls so bring me sophia' accordingly he summoned her and she came forthright and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup presented it to the sultan saying 'on the thirtieth day do thou repair to the hammam and when thou comest out enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup then sleep and thou shalt attain what thou seekest and peace be with thee' thereat the king was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands quoth she 'i commend thee to allah's care' whereat quoth he 'and when shall i see thee again o pious lady in very sooth i love not to part with thee' then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the queen whilst the king fasted after her departure other three days till the month ended when he arose and went to the hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace commanding that none should go in to him there after making fast the door he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day but he did not come out and we said 'perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day wherefore he sleepeth' so we waited till next day but still he did not come forth then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter but nothing came of that so at last we lifted up the doorfn375 and going in found him dead with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones brokenfn376 when we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed 'whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of kings and who debaucheth them and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that sharrkan when he came to our country seduced our queen abrizah nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you then hefn377 sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts this be no kingly deed and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited so do ye suspect none of having killed him for no one slew him but the cunning witch whose name is zat aldawahi and behold i have taken the king's wife sophia and have carried her to her father afridun king of constantinople moreover there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you and ye shall be cut off even to the last man nor shall a living soul be spared by death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath save he who cross and beltfn378 worshippeth' when we read this paper we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught and the troops fell out as to whom they should make sultan some would have thee and others would have thy brother sharrkan and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother sharrkan so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee and such is the manner of the death of sultan omar bin alnu'uman now when the wazir dandan had made an end of his story zau al makan and his sister nuzhat alzaman wept and the chamberlain who wept also said to zau almakan o king weeping will avail thee naught nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead thereupon zau almakan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him and the chamberlain sat by his side and all the armourbearersfn379 behind him whilst the wazir dandan and the rest of the emirs and grandees stood each in his individual stead then quoth king zau almakan to the minister dandan inform me concerning my sire's treasures and he replied i hear and i obey and gave him to know of the late king's hoards and monies and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels and acquainted him with other precious things so zau almakan opened his hand to the army and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the wazir dandan saying thou continues in office whereupon dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life then he bestowed dresses on the emirs after which he said to the chamberlain bring out before me the tribute of damascus that is with thee so he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels when he took them and parted them all amongst the troopsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her

when it was the eightyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that zau al makan ordered the chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of damascus and when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels he took them and parted them all amongst the troops till nothing was left and the emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life saying never saw we a king who gave the like of these gifts then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching so they marched for three days till on the fourth day they drew near to baghdad when they entered the city they found it decorated and zau almakan the sultan went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne whilst the emirs of the army and the wazir dandan and the chamberlain of damascus stood between his hands then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother sharrkan acquainting him with all that had passed from first to last and he concluded as soon as thou hast read this letter make ready thine affair and join us with thine army that we may turn to holy war upon the infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the minister dandan none shall carry this letter but thou and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him 'if thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom it is thine and thy brother shall be viceroy for thee in damascus for to this effect am i instructed by him' so the wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march then zau almakan bade set apart a magnificent house for the fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that firemanfn380 presently zau almakan went out chasing and hunting and as he was returning to baghdad one of the emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades one of the damsels pleased him so he went in unto her and knew her that night and she conceived by him forthright after a while the wazir dandan returned from his journey bringing him news of his brother sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him and said it were fitting thou go forth to meet him zau al makan replied i hear and i consent and riding forth with his grandees a day's journey from baghdad he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother next morning appeared king sharrkan amid the army of syria a horseman of might a lion fierce in fight a prow and doughty knight as the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high zau almakan and those with him pushed forward to meet sharrkan and his men and when zau almakan saw his brother he desired to dismount but sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise and himself footed it and walked a few paces towards himfn381 as soon as he reached zau almakan the new sultan threw himself upon him and sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other then they mounted and rode onward they and their troops till they reached baghdad where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night and when next morning came zau al makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts and proclaimed a holy war and a razziafn382 they then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good till in so doing a full month had sped and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body then sharrkan said to zau almakan o my brother tell me thy history so he told him all that had befallen him from first to last including the benevolent dealing of the fireman with him asked sharrkan 'hast thou requited his kindness and he answered o my brother i have not rewarded him as yet but inshallah i will recompense him whenas i return from this raidand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the eightyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan asked his brother zau almakan hast thou requited the fireman for his kindness and he answered o my brother i have not rewarded him as yet but inshallah i will recompense him whenas i return from this raid and find time so to do therewith sharrkan was certified that his sister nuzhat alzaman had told him the whole truth but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the chamberlain she sent him back her greeting calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter kuziafakan to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety where upon she praised almighty allah and gave him thanks then sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure and zau almakan said o my brother as soon as the army is complete and the arabs have come in from all parts we will march forth so he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife who was now five months gone with child and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians to whom he appointed stipends and allowances then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of syria and as soon as the arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions and as he fared forth he was followed by the warriors and the united host now the name of the general of the daylam army was rustam and that of the general of the army of the turksfn383 bahram and zau al makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother sharrkan and on his left the chamberlain his brotherinlaw so the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array till the whole army was in motion they ceased not to fare on for the space of a month and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days for the host was great and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the greeks then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to constantinople but when king afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to zat aldawahi the same who had contrived the stratagem and had travelled to baghdad and had slain king omar bin alnu'uman and who after carrying off her slaves and queen sophia had returned with them all to her native land now when she had been restored to her son the king of greece and felt herself safe she said to king hardub cool thine eyes for i have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter abrizah and have killed omar bin alnu'uman and have brought back sophia so now let us go to the king of constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces and i will fare with thee to king afridun lord of constantinople for i opine that the moslems will not await our attack said hardub tarry thou till they draw near our country that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war and when the news of the moslems' advance reached them they were prepared for defence and zat al dawahi had preceded them now when she and her son arrived at constantinople the king of kings afridun hearing of the approach of hardub king of the greeks came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit so hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother zat aldawahi how she had slain the moslem king and recovered from him queen sophia and had said the moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them now king afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of king omar bin alnu'uman and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the moslem king so the nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the greeks was complete besides which there joined themselves to him franks from all their lands french germansfn384 and ragusansfn385 with men of zarafn386 venetians genoese and all the hosts of the yellow facesfn387 and when the gathering was at its full earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude then afridun the great king ordered a march so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days they fared on till they reached the wady highs alnu'uman a broad sided vale hard by the salt sea where they halted three days and on the fourth they were about to set out again when news came that the army of alislam on them press and the defenders of the faith of mohammed of men the best so they halted in it other three days and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades presently there appeared beneath it the banners islamitan and the ensigns mahometan the horsemen urged forward like the letting loose of seas that surged clad in mail as they were mackerelback clouds which the moon enveil whereupon the two hosts clashed like two torrents on each other dashed eyes fell upon eyes and the first to seek combat singular was the wazir dandan he and the army of syria numbering thirty thousand bridles and with him were the general of the turks and the general of daylam rustam and bahram amid twenty thousand horse behind whom came the men from the shores of the salt sea clad in iron mail as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast then the nazarene host called out on jesus and mary and the defiledfn388 cross and they heaped themselves upon the wazir dandan and those with him of the syrian host now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman zat aldawahi for before his departure king afridun had gone in to her and asked her how shall i do and what plan shall i pursue it is thou hast caused this great distress to us and she had answered o great king and mighty cohenfn389 i will teach thee a trick would baffle iblis himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hostsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the eightyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman for that the king before his departure had gone to her and asked how shall i do and what plan shall i pursue it is thou hast caused this great distress to us and she had answered o great king and mighty cohen i will teach thee a trick would baffle the devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts it is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships and sailing over the sea to the mountain of smoke and there let them land and stir not till he standards of alislam come upon thee when do thou up and at them then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the moslems and take them in rear whilst we confront them from the landward so not one of them shall escape and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to king afridun and he replied right is the recking thou reckest o princess of wits and recourse of kings and cohens warring for their blood wit so when the army of alislam came upon them in chat valley before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents then hurried up the army of baghdad and khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse with zau almakan in the front of war when the host of the infidels that lay by the sea saw them they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks and when zau al makan espied this he cried out to his men turn back to the infidels o people of the chosen apostle and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the compassionating the compassionate so they turned and fought with the christians then sharrkan marched up with another corps of the moslem host some hundred thousand men whilst the infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men when the moslems were united their hearts were strengthened and they cried out saying verily allah hath pro mised us victory and to the infidels hath assigned defeat and they clashed together with sword and spear now sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword shouting allaho akbar allah is most great till he drove back the host to the coast then failed the force of the foe and allah gave victory to the faith of alislam and folk fought folk drunken without strong drink till they slew of the infidels in this affair forty and five thousand while of the moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell moreover the lion of the faith king sharrkan and his brother zau almakan slept not that night but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come thus far concerning the moslem but as regards king afridun lord of constantinople and sovran of roum and zat aldawahi they assembled the emirs of the host and said to them verily we had worked our will and solaced our hearts but our over confidence in our numbers and that only defeated us then quoth to them the ancient one the lady of calamities in very sooth nought shall profit you except ye draw you nigh unto the messiah and put your trust in the true belief for by the virtue of the messiah the whole strength of the moslem host lieth in that satan king sharrkan tomorrow said king afridun i have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier lk bin shamlt for if king sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed our man will slay him and will slay the other moslem knights till not one is left and i purpose this night to sacre you all with the holy incense when the emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the chief patriarch the denier the defiler of the truth and they sought for it with such instance and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the greeks used to send it to all the countries of the christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris hearing of it kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal and the chief priests and the great kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic and the patriarchs used to mix their own skitefn390 with it for that the skite of the chief patriarch could not suffice for ten countriesfn391 so as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and king afridunand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and king afridun summoned his chief knights and nobles and invested them with dresses of honour and drawing the sign of the cross on their brows incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the chief patriarch the cohen the heresiarch this incensing done he called for luka bin shamlut surnamed the sword of the messiah and after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the holy merde caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest now there was no stouter champion in the land of roum than this accursed luka nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir but he was foul of favour for his face was as the face of an ass his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness and he was branded with the mark of the infidels on facefn392 after this he came up to king afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him and the king said to him i desire thou go out against sharrkan king of damascus son of omar bin alnu'uman and deliver us from this affliction quoth luka hearkening and obedience and the king made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from heaven being near hand then luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels and he bore a trident spear as he were iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign then he rode forward he and his horde of infidels even as though they were driving to the fire preceded by a herald crying aloud in the arabic tongue and saying ho sect of mohammed upon whom be salutation and salvation let none of you come out but your champion sharrkan the sword of alislam lord of damascus in shmfn393 nor had he made an end of speaking when arose a tumult in the plain all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the day of complain then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound and lo it was king sharrkan son of king omar bin alnu'uman for when his brother zau almakan saw that accursed one push out on the plain and heard the pursuivant he turned to sharrkan and said to him of a surety they seek for thee said he should it so be 'twere most pleasing to me so when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain let none of you come out against me save sharrkan they knew this cursed luka to be champion of the land of roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of moslems now he was one of the greatest of villains a wretch who caused hearts to pain and the dayiamites turks and kurds dreaded his might and main presently sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake and recited these couplets

i have a sorrel steed whose pride is fain to bear the rein 
             shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his
             main
i have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point  upon
             whose shaft the dam of death her throny seat hath ta'en
i have a trenchant glaive of hind and when i bare its face  of
             scabbard veil from out its brow the rays of levee rain

luka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse but he smote his forehead with his hand in honour of the cross drawn thereon and kissed it then he couched his throw spear and ran at sharrkan but first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight and catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers hurled it at sharrkan it flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for sharrkan but as the spear flew near him he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view as it descended he caught it again with the other hand in less than the twinkling of an eye and cried out from his heart core saying by the truth of him who created the sevenfold skies i will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise then threw he the throw spear at luka who thought to do as sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight but sharrkan prevented him and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead in the very centre of the sign of the cross and allah hurried his soul to the fire and dwelling place direfn394 but when the infidels saw luka bin shamlut fall slain they buffeted their faces and they cried alas and woe worth the day and called for aid upon the abbots of the monasteriesand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the ninetyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the infidels saw luka bin shamlut fall slain they buffeted their faces and cried alas and woe worth the day and called upon the abbots of the monasteries and cried where be the crosses so the religious offered up prayers and the christians all drew together against sharrkan and brandishing their scymitars and lances rushed forward to the attack then army met army and breasts fell under hoof whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legsfn395 nor did the herald ofwar cease calling to fight till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight so the two hosts drew apart whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave for that with so much cut and thrust they strave and the place was choked with the slain fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell then sharrkan joined his brother zau almakan and the chamberlain and the wazir dandan and said to them verily allah hath opened a door for the infidels to fall praised be the lord of the worlds one and all replied zau almakan let us never cease to praise allah for that he hath dispelled trouble from the arab and the ajam indeed the folk generation after generation shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed luka the falsifier of the evangelfn396 of thy catching the throng spear in midflight and how the enemy of allah among men thou didst smite and thy fame shall endure until the end of time then said sharrkan harkye o grand chamberlain and doughty capitayne and he answered adsumfn397 quoth sharrkan take with thee the wazir dandan and twenty thousand horse and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the infidels disembarking from their ships and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them and whenso ye see our troops falling back as if defeated and all the infidels following them as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents do ye still lie in wait for them but as soon as ye see the standard with the words there is no god but the god and mohammed is god's apostle on whom be salutation and salvation then up with the green banner and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout 'alla ho akbar allah is most great' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea he replied to hear is to obey and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth now the chamberlain took with himself the wazir dandan and twenty thousand men even as sharrkan had commanded as soon as dawned the morn the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear then the christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the ecclesiastsfn398 cried out and all heads were bared and those in the ships hoisted the cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white and all joined fight and the grind mill of death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore the host of alislam called out saying on the prince of mankind be blessings and peace and to the compassionate glory and praise which ne'er shall cease for his boons which aye increase and the host of the infidels shouted glory to the cross and the belt and the vine press juice and the wine presser and the priests and the monks and the festival of palms and the metropolitan now zau almakan and sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy while the infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout and made ready to foin and hew then the meiny of the moslems raised their voices reciting the first verses of the chapter of the cowfn399 whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds and the heralds of the greeks cried out ho servants of the messiah ho people of the true faith ho followers of the primatefn400 verily divine grace upon you opes for see the hosts of al islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope so turn ye not to them your backs but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them else are ye outcasts from the messiah mary's son who spoke even when a cradled onefn401 now afridun king of constantinople deemed that the infidels were victorious knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the moslems and sent to king hardub of roum congratulations on success adding availed us naught but the holy merde of the arch patriarch whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the cross near and far and i swear by the miracles of the messiah and by thy daughter abrizah the nazarene the mariolater and by the waters of baptism that i will not leave upon the earth a single defender of al islam and to the bitter end will i carry out this plan so the messenger betook himself with the address to king hardub whilst the infidels called to one another saying take we vengeance wreak for lukaand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the ninetysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the infidels called to one another saying take we vengeance wreak for luka while hardub king of greece cried aloud ho to our revenge for abrizah thereupon king zau almakan shouted ho servants of the requiting king smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear so the moslems returned to the infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar whilst their herald cried aloud up and at the foes of the faith all ye who love the prophet elect with hope of salvation on the day of fear to win favour of the bountiful the forgiving one for verily the garden of paradise is under the shadow of swords and behold sharrkan and his men charged down upon the infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks when lo a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the deniers cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks so that the faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew he was girt with two swords his glances and his brand and he was armed with two lances one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors even as saith the poet

laud not long hairfn402 except it be dispread  in two fold
            locks on day of fight and fray
o'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh  from
             many a whis kered knight to win the day
and as singeth another

i say to him what while he slings his sword  'for sword shall
             serve those looks that sword like show'
says he 'my sabre looks for those i love  my sword for those
             who sweets of love unknow'

when sharrkan saw him he said to him i conjure thee by the koran and the attributes of the compassionate one o champion of the champions tell me who thou art for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the requiting king whom one thing distracteth not from other thing in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling then cried the cavalier to him saying thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday how quickly thou hast forgotten me thereupon he withdrew his mouth veilfn403 so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed and lo it was none other than zau almakan then sharrkan rejoiced in his brother save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting and this for two reasons the first his tender age and exposure to the evil eye and the second that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings so he said to him o king thou riskest thy life so join thy steed to mine in very sooth i fear for thee from the foe and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft quoth zau almakan i desire to even thee in fray and i will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay then the host of alislam heaping itself upon the infidels girt them on all sides warred on them a right holy war and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre but king afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the greek and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight making for the ships when lo there came out upon them from the seacoast another host led by the minister dandan the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust and to lay load on them with cut and thrust nor less came forth the emir bahram lord of the provinces of sham amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm and the host of alislam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm then a body of the moslems turned against those who in the ships remained and perdition on them rained till they threw themselves into the main and they slew of them many slain more than a hundred thousand noblemen nor was one of their champions great or small saved from bale and bane moreover they took their ships with all the money and treasure and cargo save a score of keel and the moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's earsfn404 now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic whereat the moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that allah had given them victory and protection such was the case with them but as regards the fugitive infidels they soon reached constantinople whither the tidings preceded them that king afridun had prevailed over the moslems so quoth the ancient dame zat aldawahi i know that my son hardub king of roum is no runagate and that he feareth not the islamitic hosts but will restore the whole world to the nazarene faith then she bade the great king afridun give command that the city be decorated and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of destiny now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings behold the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the king of csarea so king afridun lord of constantinople met them on the sea shore and they told him all that had befallen them from the moslem and they wept sore and groaned and moaned and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal and they informed him concerning luka son of shamlut how calamity had betided him and how death had shot him with his shaft thereat the horrors of doomday rose upon king afridunfn405 and he knew that there was no making straight their crook then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening and sighs and cries were heard from all sides and when king hardub of greece met king afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit and said to him look not to see any of the army save those who have already reached thee when king afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit with his nose under his feet and as soon as he revived he exclaimed surely the messiah was wroth with them that he caused the moslems to prevail over them then came the arch patriarch sadly to the king who said to him o our father annihilation hath overtaken our army and the messiah hath punished us replied the patriarch grieve not nor feel concerned for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the messiah and all have been punished for his offence but now we will read prayers for you in the churches that the mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you after which the old woman zat aldawahi came to afridun and said to him o king verily the moslem hosts are many and we shall never overcome them save by wile wherefore i purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of alislam haply i may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion even as i slew his father if my stratagem succeed in his case not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land for all are strong only because of him but i desire to have some christian dwellers of syria such as go out every month and year to sell their goods that they may help me for this they can do in carrying out my plan replied the king be it so whenever thou wilt so she bade fetch an hundred men natives of najrnfn406 in sham and the king asked them have ye not heard what hath befallen the christians with the moslems yes answered they and he rejoined know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the messiah and purposeth to go forth with you disguised as monotheists and mohammedans to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the moslem from us say then are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the anointed and i will give you a quintal of goldfn407 he of you who escapeth shall have the money and him of you who dieth will the messiah reward o king replied they we will devote our lives to the messiah and we will be thy sacrifice thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted she waited till the decoction was cold then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith moreover she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary and afterwards went in to king afridun who knew her not nor did any of his companions know her till she discovered herself to them and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning and her son rejoiced and said may the messiah never fail thee thereupon she took with her the syrian christians and set out for the army of baghdad and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king afridun heard these words he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet and as soon as he revived fear fluttered the scrotumfn408 below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame zat aldawahi now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches past mistress in sorcery and deception wanton and wily deboshed and deceptious with foul breath red eyelids yellow cheeks dull brown face eyes bleared mangy body hair grizzled back humped skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran but she had studied the scriptures of alislam and had made the pilgrimage to the holy house of meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the koran and she had professed judaism in the holy city of jerusalemfn409 for two years' space that she might master the magic of men and demons so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son king hardub of greece was on account of the slave virgins at his court for she was given to tribadismfn410 and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad so if any damsel pleased her she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffronfn411 till she fainted away for excess of volupty whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy and so she abode for a length of time this was known to marjanah and rayhnah and utrijah the handmaids of abrizah and their princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her because of the rank smell from her armpits the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre she was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions but abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the omnipotent the omniscient for by allah right well quoth the poet

ho thou who grovellest low before the great  nor over fording
             lesser men dost blench
who gildest dross by dirham gathering  no otter scent disguises
             carrion stench

and now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working presently she departed taking the chief nazarenes with their hosts and turned towards the army of the moslems whereupon king hardub went in to king afridun and said to him o king we have no need of the chief patriarch nor of his prayers but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the moslem hosts for these are marching with all their power they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides when king afridun heard this terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters without stay or delay to all the nations of the nazarenes saying it behoveth none of the messiahites or cross knights to hold back especially the folk of the strongholds and forts but let them all come to us foot and horse women and children for the moslem hosts already tread our soil so haste haste ye ere what we fear to us here appear thus much concerning them but regarding the work of the old woman zat aldawahi when she went forth from the city with her suite she clad them in the clothing of moslem merchants having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of antioch such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth and she had taken a letter from king afridun to the following effect these be merchantmen from the land of sham who have been with us so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance nor take tax and tithe of them till they reach their homes and safe places for by merchants a country flourisheth and these are no men of war nor of ill faith then quoth the accursed zat aldawahi to those with her verily i wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the moslem replied they o queen command us whatso thou wilt we are at thy disposal and may the messiah never disappoint thy dealings then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion so that it shone with prodigious sheen now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed and she bound her legs tightly round with cordsfn412 just above her feet till she drew near the moslem camp when she unwound them leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating and set her in a chest and quoth she cry abroad the refrain of unityfn413 nor fear from it aught of damage replied they how can we beat thee who be our sovereign lady zat aldawahi mother of the king we glory in then said she we blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes and in need evil becometh good deed when ye have set me in the chest take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the moslem camp and fear ye no blame and if any of the moslems hinder you give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their king zau almakan and implore his protection saying 'we were in the land of the infidels and they took nothing from us but wrote us a passport that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance' if he ask you 'what profit had ye of your property in the land of roum' answer him 'we profited in the deliverance of a pious man who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years crying out for help yet none helped him nay the infidels tortured him night and day we knew not this but after we had tarried in constantinople for some time having sold our goods and bought others in their stead we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land we spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it behold it moved and said 'o moslems is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the lord of the three worlds'fn414 'how so' asked we and the figure answered 'know that allah hath made me speak to you to the intent that your faith be fortified and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the infidels and repair to the moslem host for with them wones the sword of the com passionate one of our age the champion king sharrkan by whom he shall conquer constantinople town and destroy the sect of the nazarene and when ye shall have journeyed three days you will find an hermitage known as the hermitage of the ascetic matruhinafn415 and containing a cell visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will for therein is a religious from the holy city jerusalem by name abdullah and he is one of the devoutest of mankind endowed with the power of working saintly miraclesfn416 such as dispel doubts and obscurity certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time by his deliverance you will please the lord of faithful men for such release is better than fighting for the faith' now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words she said as soon as that which i impart shall reach the ears of king sharrkan say him further 'hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the ninetyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the old woman zat aldawahi and those with her had agreed upon such words she said now as soon as that which i impart shall reach the ears of king sharrkan say him further 'hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and allah's servants of purest qualities so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling as is the wont of merchants as soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon and we heard the holy man after chanting some verses of the koran repeat the following couplets

'my heart disheartened is my breast is strait  and sinks my
            soul in sea of bale and bate
unless escape be near i soon shall die  and death were better
             than this doleful strait
o lightning an thou light my home and folk  an their still
             brighter charms thy shine abate
say what my path to meet them being barred  by wars and
             barricado'd succour's gate'

when once ye have brought me into the moslem camp and i mix with them you shall see the old woman continued how i will make shift to beguile them and slay them all even to the last man the nazarenes hearing whet she said kissed her hands and set her in the chest after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this then they all made for the moslem host as hath erst been said such was the case with the damned hag zat aldawahi and her companions but as regards the mohammeden army they indeed after allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards all sat down to converse with one another and zau almakan said to his brother sharrkan verily allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves wherefore continue o sharrkan to obey my commandment in submission to allah be he exalted and extolled for i mean to slay ten kings in blood revenge for my sire to cut the throat of fifty thousand greeks and to enter constantinople replied sharrkan my life be thy ransom against death needs must i follow out the holy war though i wone many a year in their country but i have o my brother in damascus a daughter named kuzia fakan whom i love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age' said zau almakan and i also have left my wife with child and near her time nor do i know what allah will vouchsafe me by her but promise me o my brother that if allah bless me with a son thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon with love and good will replied sharrkan and stretching out his hand to his brother he said if she bring thee a son i will give him my daughter kuzia fakan to wife at this zau almakan rejoiced and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy and the wazir dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them know o ye kings that allah hath given us the victory for that we have devoted our lives to him be he exalted and ex tolled and we have left our homes and households and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him so haply allah shall enable us to win our wishes and we shall destroy our enemies branch and root if it please you do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight and the minister dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said

to slay my foes is chiefest bliss i wist  and on the courser's
            back be borne a list
comes promising tryst a messenger from friend  full oft when
            comes the friend withouten tryst
and these words of another

war for my mother an i live i'll take  spear for my brother
           scymitar for sire
with every shag haired brave who meets his death  smiling till
           won from doom his dear desire

and when the wazir ended his verses he said praise be to him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold then zau almakan commanded the army to depart and they fared on forcing their marches for constantinople till they came to a wide and spacious champaign full of all things fair and fain with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were paradise for it had donned its adornments and decked itselffn417 gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew and combined with the nectar of tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty even as saith the poet

behold this lovely garden 'tis as though  spring o'er its
           frame her greeny cloak had spread
looking with fleshly eyne thou shalt but sight  a lake whose
            waters balance in their bed
but look with spirit eyes and lo shalt see  glory in every
           leaf o'erwaves thy head

and as another saith

the stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed  whose downfn418
          is creeping shade of tamarisk stems
round legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings  silvern and
           blossoms are the diadems

when zau almakan saw this champaign with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling he called to his brother sharrkan and said o my brother verily in damascus is naught the like of this place we will not march from it save after three days that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of alislam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed infidels so they halted therein and while camping behold they heard a noise of voices from afar and zau almakan asked the cause thereof and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the land of syria had halted there to rest and that the moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the infidels after a while up came the merchants crying out and appealing to the king for aidance when zau al makan saw this he bade them be brought before him and when in presence they said to him o king we have been in the country of the infidels and they plundered us of nothing why then do our brothers the moslems despoil our goods and we in their own land of a truth when we saw your troops we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the king of constantinople and sharrkan read it and said we will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the infidels replied they o our lord in very sooth allah despatched us thither that we might win what ghzifn419 never won the like of not even thou in all thy razzias asked sharrkan what was it ye won o king answered they we will not tell thee save in private for if this matter be noised among the folk haply it may come to the ears of somefn420 and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all moslems who resort to the land of the greeks now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned zat al dawahi so zau almakan and his brother brought them to a private place where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two kings weepand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the nazarenes who wore merchants' weed when brought to a private place by zau almakan and his brother sharrkan laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch zat aldawahi thereupon sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of almighty allah so quoth he to them did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage quoth they we delivered him and slew the hermit fearing for our lives after which we made haste to fly for dread of death but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman as she were a cassia podfn421 for excess of blackness and leanness and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles when zau almakan and the bystanders saw her they took her for a man of the best of allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face so zau almakan and sharrkan wept sore then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet sobbing aloud but she signed to them and said cease this weeping and hear my words hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding and she said know ye both that i was content to accept what my lord did unto me for i kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from him be he exalted and extolled and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation for him there is no coming to the delights of paradise i had indeed supplicated him that i might return to my native land not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me but that i might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the faith who being slain in fray live again without suffering deathfn422 then she repeated the following couplets

our fort is torfn423 and flames the fire of fight  moses
            art thou and this is time for aid
cast down thy rod 'twill swallow all they wrought  nor dread
            for men their ropes be vipers madefn424
for chapters read on fight day lines of foes  and on their
            necks 'grave versetsfn425 wi' thy blade

when the old woman had ended her verse her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light and sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her but she refused it saying i have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years and how should i break it at such a time when my lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire i will wait till sun down so when it was nightfall sharrkan and zau almakan came and served her with food and said eat o ascetic but she said this is no time for eating it is the time for worshipping the requiting king then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights sitting not but at the time of the salm or salutationfn426 ending with several prayers when zau al makan saw her on this wise firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to sharrkan cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this religious and appoint a body servant to wait upon him on the fourth day she called for food so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt then she again turned to her fast and as the night came she rose anew to pray when sharrkan said to zau almakan verily this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing and were it not for this holy war i would join myself to him and worship allah in his service till i came before his presence and now i desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour quoth zau almakan and i also tomorrow we sally forth to fight against constantinople and we shall find no time like the present said the wazir dandan and i no less desire to see this ascetic haply he will pray for me that i find death in this holy war and come to the presence of my lord for i am aweary of the world so as soon as night had darkened they repaired to the tent of that witch zat aldawahi and seeing her standing to pray they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation then she turned to them and after wishing them long life asked them wherefore come ye whereto they answered o thou holy man diddest thou not hear us weep around thee she rejoined to him who standeth in the presence of allah remaineth no existence in time either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him quoth they we would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night for that will profit us more than the possession of constantinople now when she heard their words she said by allah were ye not the emirs of the moslems i would not relate to you aught of this at any time for i complain not but to allah alone however to you i will relate the circumstances of my captivity know then that i was in the saintly city of jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men and did not magnify myself among them for that allah be he exalted and extolled had endowed me with humility and abnegation till i chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water then entered into me pride whence i know not and i said to myself 'who like me can walk the water' and my heart from that time hardened and allah afflicted me with the love of travel so i journeyed to roum land and visited every part for a whole year and left no place but therein i worshiped allah when i came to this spotfn427 i clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage inhabited by a monk called matrubina who when he sighted me came out and kissed my hands and feet and said 'verily i have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the greeks and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of alislam' then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage and brought me to a dark room and when i entered it unawares he locked the door on me and left me there forty days without meat or drink for it was his intent to kill me by delay it chanced one day that a knight called dakiansfn428 came to the hermitage accompanied by ten squires and his daughter tamsil a girl whose beauty was incom parable when they entered that hermitage the monk matruhina told them of me and the knight said 'bring him out for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat' so they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche praying and reciting the koran and glorifying allah and humbling myself before the almighty when they saw me in this state matrohina exclaimed 'this man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers' and hearing his words they all came in on me dakianus and his company withal and they beat me with a grievous beating till i desired death and reproached myself saying 'this is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which allah hath vouchsafed to him beyond his own competence and thou o my soul verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee dost thou not know that pride angereth the lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the fire' then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground every three days they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water and every month or two the knight came to the hermitage now his daughter tamasil had grown up for she was nine years old when i first saw her and fifteen years passed over me in captivity so that she had reached her four and twentieth year there is not in our land nor in the land of the greeks a fairer than she and her father feared lest the king take her from him for she had vowed herself to the messiah and rode with dakianus in the habit of a cavalier so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness no one who saw her knew her for a woman and her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein and i saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities none may keep count of them save almighty allah now ye are worthier of these riches than those infidels so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the moslems and especially on fighters in the holy war when these merchants came to constantinople and sold their merchandise that image which is on the wall spoke to them by grace of a marvel which allah granted to me so they made for that hermitage and slew matruhina after torturing him with most grievous torments and dragging him by the beard till he showed them the place where i was when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death now tomorrow night tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit and her father and his squires will come after her as he feareth for her so if ye would witness these things take me with you and i will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the knight dakianus which be in that mountain for i saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom and i heard a damsel of their company sing to them in arabic and wellaway that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the koran if then ye will enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of dakianus and his daughter and take her for she is fit only for the king of the age sharrkan or king zau almakan thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the wazir dandan who put scant faith in her story for her words took no hold on his reason and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his facefn429 yet he was confounded at her discourse but he feared to speak with her for awe of the king then quoth the ancient dame zat aldawahi verily i fear lest the knight come and seeing these troops encamped in the meadow be afraid to enter the hermitage so zau almakan ordered the army to march upon constantinople and said i have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage then he sent at once for the chief chamberlain whom they brought into the presence and he summoned likewise the leaders of the turks and daylamites and said as soon as it is dawn do ye set forth for constantinople and thou o chamberlain shalt take my place in council and contrivance while thou o rustam shalt be my brother's deputy in battle but let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders and he and sharrkan and the minister dandan set out for the hermitage and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasureand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan and his brother zau almakan and the wazir dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed zat aldawahi and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure now as soon as dawned the morn the chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure and they set out thinking that the two kings and the wazir were with them knowing not that the three had made for the monastery such was the case with the host but as regards the two kings and the minister they tarried in their place till the end of that day now the infidels who were with zat aldawahi took their departure privily after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march so she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile and when it was dark night she arose and went in to zau almakan and his companions and said to them come let us set out for the mountain and take with you a few men at arms they obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain whilst the rest rode on before zat aldawahi who gained new strength for excess of joy so that zau almakan said glory be to him who sustaineth this holy man whose like we never saw now the witch had written a letter to the king of constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a birdfn430 acquainting him with what had passed and ending i wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution lest the host of alislam get sight of them and when they reach the hermitage let them ambush themselves there till i come to them with the moslem king and his brother for i shall inveigle them and will bring them thither together with the wazir and an hundred horse and no more that i may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage i am resolved to slay the monk matruhina since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life if my plot work well not one of the moslems shall return to his own country no not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight and matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the nazarene faith and the servants of the cross and praise be to the messiah first and last when this letter reached constantinople the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to king afridun who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and after reaching the tower to hide therein thus far concerning them but as regards king zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan and the escort when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the monk matruhina who came out to see who and what they were whereupon quoth that pious man zat aldawahi slay this damned fellowfn431 so they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them and after gathering the whole together they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith as for tamasil she came not she or her father for fear of the moslems so zau almakan tarried there awaiting her all that day and the next and a third till sharrkan said to him by allah i am troubled anent the army of alislam for i know not what is become of them his brother replied and i also am concerned for them we have come by this great treasure and i do not believe that tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage after that befel which hath befallen the host of the christians it behoveth us then to content ourselves with what allah hath given us and depart so haply he will help us conquer constantinople accordingly they came down from the mountain while zat aldawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse as soon as these saw the moslems they encircled them from all sides couching lance and baring the white sabre blade and the infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring when zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the minister dandan looked upon this host they saw that it was a numerous army and said who can have given these troops information of us replied sharrkan o my brother this be no time for talk this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts for this strait is like a street with two gates though by the virtue of the lord of arabs and ajams were not the place so narrow i would bring them to naught even though they were an hundred thousand men said zau almakan had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse and the wazir dandan continued if we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows but allah will succour us against them i know this defile and its straitness and i know there be many places of refuge in it for i have been here on razzia with king omar bin alnu'uman what while we besieged constantinople we abode in this place and here is water colder than snow so come let us push out of this defile ere the infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top whence they will hurl down rocks upon us and we powerless to come at them so they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows but the pious man zat aldawahi looked at them and said what is it ye fear ye who have vowed yourselves to the lord and to working his will by allah i abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years yet never gainsaid the almighty in aught he did with me fight ye in allah's way so whoever of you is slain paradise shall be his abode and whoso slayeth his striving shall be to his honour when they heard from the ascetic these words their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the infidels charged down from all sides whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them the moslems fought for the service of allah a right good fight and wrought upon his foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance whilst zau almakan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight five by five and ten by ten till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting now while so doing he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them and all who feared fled to her for shelter but she was also signing the infidels to slay sharrkan so troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die but each troop that charged he charged and drove back and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory and he said in himself verily on this holy men allah looketh with eyes of his favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the infidels with the purity of his pious intent for i see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight so they battled the rest of the day and when night fell the moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone and that day were slain of them five and forty and when they were gathered together they sought the devotee but could find no trace of him and this was grievous to them and they said belike he hath died a martyr quoth sharrkan i saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of holy writ now while they were talking behold the accursed old woman zat aldawahi stood before them hending in hand the head of the chief captain of the ten thousand horse a noble knight a champion fierce in fight and a satan for blight one of the turks had slain him with an arrow and allah hurried his soul to the fire and when the infidels saw what that moslem had done with their leader they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords and allah hurried his soul to heaven then the accursed old woman cut off that knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of sharrkan and zau almakan and the wazir dandan now when sharrkan sew her he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed praised be allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee o holy man and devout champion of the religion replied she o my son i have sought martyrdom this day and have thrown my life away amid the infidel array but they feared me with dismay when ye dispersed i waxed jealous for your honour so i rushed on the chief knight their leader albeit he was a match for a thousand horse and i smote him till i severed head from trunk not one of the infidels could near me so i brought his head to youand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the ninetyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the damned witch zat aldawahi took the head of the knight the leader of the twenty thousand infidels she brought it and threw it down before zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan saying when i saw your condition i waxed jealous for your honour so i rushed on the chief knight and smote him with the sword till i severed head from trunk and none could near me so i brought his head to you that you may be strengthened in holy war and work out with your swords the will of the lord of the faithful and now i purpose leaving you to strive against the infidels whilst i go to your army though they be at the gates of constantinople and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these unfaithfuls quoth sharrkan how wilt thou pass to them o thou holy man seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the miscreants quoth the accursed hag allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight mefn432 nor if any saw me would he dare to attack me at that time for i shall be as one non existing absorbed in allah and he will fend off from me his foes thou sayest sooth o holy man rejoined sharrkan for indeed i have been witness of that so if thou can pass out at the first of the night 'twill be best for us replied she i will set out at this very hour and if thou desire thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him but none else for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain sharrkan said as for me i will not leave my comrades but if my brother will there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait for he is the stronghold of the moslems and the sword of the lord of the three worlds and if it be his pleasure let him take with him the wazir dandan or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs so after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the infidels if they be asleep or awake quoth they we will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to allah if i do your bidding replied she blame me not but blame yourselves for it is my rede that you await me till i bring you tidings of the case then said sharrkan go to them and delay not from us for we shall be awaiting thee thereupon she fared forth and sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said were not this holy man a miracle worker he had never slain yonder furious knight this is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power and of a truth the pride of the infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier for he was violent an evil devil and a stubborn now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee behold the accursed zat aldawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the unbelievers wherefor they thanked her not knowing that all this was wile and guile and the damned hag asked where be the king of the age zau almakan and the minister dandan answered he here am i take with thee thy wazir said she and follow after me that we may fare forth to constantinople now she had acquainted the infidels with the cheat she had put upon the moslems and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and said our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their king in return for the knight's death because we had no stouter rider than he and they added bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the moslems when thou bringest him to us we will bear him to king afridun then she went out and went out with her zau almakan and the minister dandan and she walked on before the two saying fare forth with the blessing of almighty allah so they did her bidding for the shaft of pate and fortune of man's lot had shot them and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the grecian camp till they came to the defile the narrow pass aforesaid whilst the infidel enemy watched them but did them no hindrance for the infernal old woman had enjoined this now when zau almakan and the wazir dandan saw that the infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight the wazir exclaimed by allah this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles and doubtless he be of the elect rejoined zau almakan by allah i think the infidels be naught but blind for we see them and they see us not and while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers behold the infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them saying is there anyone else with you twain that we may seize upon him too and the wazir dandan replied see you not yon other man that is before us ' replied the unbelievers by the truth of the messiah and the monks and the primate and the metropolitan we see none save you two then zau almakan said by allah this is a chastisement decreed to us by almighty allahand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the unfaithful had seized upon king zau almakan and the wazir dandan they said to the two is there anyone else with you twain that we may seize upon him also and the wazir dandan replied see you not yon other man who be with us they rejoined by the truth of the messiah and the monks and the primate and the metropolitan we see none save you two then the infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night whilst zat aldawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight so they fell to lamenting and saying to each other verily the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us so far concerning zau almakan and the wazir dandan but as regards king sharrkan he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer he and his men made ready to do battle with the infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good then they sallied out till they were hard upon the unbelievers and when these saw them from afar they cried out to them saying o moslems we have taken captives your sultan and your wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs and except ye leave off fighting us we will slay you to the last man but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our king who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught and we will do you no harm in aught if ye accept it will be well for you but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death so we have told you sooth and this is our last word to you now when sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the wazir dandan he was weighed down with woe and wept his force failed him and making sure of death he said to himself would i knew the cause of their capture did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him or what was the matter then they sprang up to battle with the unbelievers and slew great numbers of them the brave was known that day from craven men and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain for the infidels flocked up on them as flies flock to drink from hill and from plain but sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore and when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place and the moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on allah and the scymitar now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest emirs and they had killed thousands of the infidels footmen and fighters on horse when sharrkan saw this the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades what shall we do whereto all answered that which almighty allah willeth shall befal us on the morning of the second day sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop if ye go forth to fight not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water so i deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern to hinder any from entering haply the holy man may have reached the moslem host and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the infidels for belike the unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him they said this were the better course to take and of its expediency no doubt we make so the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls and every one of the infidels who sought to enter in they slew thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dunand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the ninetyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the army of the moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe and every one of the infidels attempted to charge them him they slew and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun by which time king sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left then quoth the infidels to one another when shall these battle days have an end we are weary of warring the moslems and quoth one of them up and at them for there remain of them but five and twenty men if we cannot prevail on them to fight let us light a fire upon themfn433 and if they submit themselves and yield to us we will take them prisoners but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire may the messiah on their fathers have no grace and may the sojourn of the nazarenes be for them no abiding place so they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it thereupon sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners and while they were in this condition lo the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter it is not for any save for king afridun to kill them that he may gratify his wrath therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow when we will journey with them to constantinople and deliver them to our king who shall deal with them as he please said they this is the right course and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them then as soon as it was black night the infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs now sharrkan and his brother zau almakan were in confinement and so also were his companion knights whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him o my brother how win free by allah replied zau al makan i know not for here we be like birds in cage then sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself till his pinion bonds brass asunder whereupon being free he arose and went up to the captain of the guard and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters freed zau almakan and the wazir dandan and the rest of his men then he turned to the two and said i desire to slay three of these infidels and take and don their dress we three so that we shall be guised as greeks and we will pass through them with out their knowing us and fare forth to our own force replied zau almakan this is no safe counsel for if we kill them i fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us 'twere the surer way to pass out of the defile so they agreed upon this and set out and when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping and sharrkan said to his brother better we take each one of us a steed there were five and twenty horsemen so they took five and twenty horses whilst allah sent sleep upon the infidels for a purpose he knew and the faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach meanwhile sharrkan set to gathering from the infidels as many weapons swords and spears as were wanted and while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the infidels supposed that anyone could release zau almakan and his brother and their men or that their prisoners had power to escape now when all the captives were safe from the unfaithful sharrkan came up with his comrades and found them awaiting his arrival on coals of flame expecting him in anxious grame so he turned to them and said feel no fear since allah protecteth us i have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose what is it asked they and he answered i desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice 'allaho akbar' and ye add 'the army of al islam is upon you allaho akbar' this wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk but they will think that the moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn replied zau almakan this plan is not good we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word for if we cry out 'allaho akbar' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape rejoined sharrkan by allah though they should awake tis no matter and i long that ye fall in with my plan for naught save good can come of it so they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted allaho akbar and hills and trees and rocks reworded their allaho akbar for fear of the almighty but when the kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one anotherand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundredth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan spake thus i long that ye fall in with this my plan for naught save good can come of it so they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted allaho akbar and hills and trees and rocks re worded their allaho akbar for fear of the almighty the infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said the foe is upon us by the truth of the messiah then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save almighty allah as soon as it was dawn they sought for the captives but found no trace of them and their captains said they who did this were the prisoners in our possession up then and after them in all haste till ye overtake them when we will make them quaff the cup of requital and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you so they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them now when zau almakan saw this he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother what i feared would come is come upon us and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the faith but sharrkan preferred to hold his peace then zau al makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest shouting allaho akbar and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the lord of faithful men and while they were in this case behold they heard many voices voicing there is no god but the god god is most great salutation and salvation upon the apostle the bringer of glad tidings the bearer of bad tidings''fn434 so they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of moslems who believed in one god pushing towards them whereat their hearts were heartened and sharrkan charged upon the infidels crying out there is no god but the god god is most great he and those with him so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the moslems followed them with lunge and blow and zau almakan and his comrades of the moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the infidel foe and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight thereupon the moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations and when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen they saw bahram the captain of the daylamites and rustam the captain of the turks advancing to join them with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim as soon as they saw zau almakan the riders dismounted and saluted him and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of unbelievers then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after resurrection day now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this when the emir bahram and the emir rustam and the chief chamberlain with the moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead came in sight of constantinople they saw that the nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts and had set all their defenders in order of defence as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of alislam and the banners mohammedan and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the moslems with their standards and ensigns of the faith of unity under the dust clouds and lo they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain and the voices of the moslems chanting the koran and glorifying the compassionate one struck their ears now the infidels knew of the approach of this host through zat aldawahi with her craft and whoredomfn435 calumny and contrivance and the armies of alislam drew near as it were the swollen sea for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children then quoth the general of the turks to the general of the daylamites o emir of a truth we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows indeed yon infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a sultan in very sooth we run danger from these enemies whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold especially in the absence of king zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the illustrious wazir dandan if they know of this they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man not one of us safety shall see so it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the turks and march them to the hermitage of matruhina and the meadow of malkhin in quest of our brothers and comrades if thou act by my advice it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance in case they be hard pressed by the infidels and if thou act not blame will not attach to me but an ye go it behoveth that ye return quickly for ill suspicion is part of prudence the emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned so much for the cause of their coming but as regards the ancient dame zat aldawahi as soon as she had delivered sultan zau almakan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan into the hands of the infidels the foul whore mounted a swift steed saying to the faithless i design to rejoin the moslem army which is at constantinople and contrive for their destruction for i will inform them that their chiefs are dead and when they hear that from me their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered then will i go to king afridun lord of constantinople and to my son hardub king of roum and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive so she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night and when day dawned appeared the armies of bahram and rustam advancing towards her so she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself haply the moslem hosts be returning routed from the assault of constantinople however as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversedfn436 and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men but fearing for their king and comrades when she was assured of this she hastened towards them running at speed like a devil of ill rede till reaching them she cried out haste ye haste ye o soldiers of the compassionate one hasten to the holy war against the hosts of satan when bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her o friend of allah what is behind thee answered she question not of sad case and sore condition for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of matruhina and designed to win their way constantinople wards thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the infidels and the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror adding the most of them are dead and there are but five and twenty men left said bahram o holy man when didst thou leave them but this nightfn437 replied she he cried glory be to allah to him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a midrib of palmtree but thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by his directionsfn438 then he mounted his horse and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies and he said there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us for our sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him then they cut across the country wide and side night and day and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw zau almakan and sharrkan shouting there is no god but the god allaho akbar and salutation and salvation upon the congratulator the comminatorfn439 whereupon he and his drove at the unbelievers and whelmed them as the rain torrent whelms the waste and cried out their war cries till fear get hold of the prowess knights and the mountains were cloven in affright and when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant and each recognised other as hath been said before then they kissed the ground before the king and before his brother sharrkan who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave now thereat they marvelled and said to one another hasten we back to constantinople for we left our companions there and our hearts are with them so they hurried departure commending themselves to the subtle the allwise and zau almakan exhorted the moslems to steadfast ness and versified in the following coupletsfn440

be praises mine to all praiseworthy thee  o lord who stinted
            not mine aid to be
though was i lost abroad thou west to me  strongest support
            which vouchsafed victory
thou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts  and slungest
            con quering sword of valiancy
thou mad'st me blest beneath thy kingly shade  engraced with
            generous boons dealt fain and free
thou savedst from every fear i feared by aid  of my wazir the
            age's noblest he
garred us thy grace in fight to throw the greek  who yet came
             back dight in war's cramoisie
then made i feint to fly from out the fight  but like grim lion
           turning made them flee
and left on valley sole my foemen drunk  not with old
           winefn441 but deathcup's revelry
then came the saintly hermit and he showed  his marvels wrought
            for town and wold to see
when slew they herowights who woke to dwell  in eden bowers
           wherein sweet rilllets well

but when zau almakan had made an end of versifying his brother sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their armyand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and first night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sharrkan congratulated his brother zau almakan on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army such was their case but as regards the old woman zat aldawahi after she had foregathered with the hosts of rustam and bahram she returned to the coppice where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed till she drew near the moslem army that beleaguered constantinople when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the chief chamberlain and when he saw her he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said welcome o pious recluse then he questioned her of what had befallen and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies saying in sooth i fear for the emir rustam and the emir bahram for that i met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the king and his companions now there are but twenty thousand horse and the unbelievers outnumber them so i would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour lest they be slain to the last man and she cried to them haste haste when the chamberlain and the moslems heard these words their spirits fell and they wept but zat aldawahi said to them ask aidance of allah and bear patiently this triburation for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of mohammed and paradise with its palaces is laid out by allah for those who die martyrs and needs must all die but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the faith the chamberlain hearing this speech of the accursed old woman called for the emir bahram's brother a knight by name tarkash and choosing out for him ten thousand horse riders famed for force bade him set out at once so he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night till he neared the moslems when daylight dawned sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of alislam and said if these troops which are coming upon us be moslem men our victory is assured by them but if these be nazarenes there is no gainsaying destiny's decrees then he turned to his brother zau al makan and said never fear for with my life i will ransom thee from death if these be mohammedan troops then were it an increase of heavenly favours but if they be our foes there is no help save that we fight them yet do i long to meet the holy man ere i die so i may beg him to pray that i die not save by death of martyrdom whilst the twain were thus speaking behold there appeared the banners inscribed with the words there is no god but the god and mohammed is the apostle of god and sharrkan cried out how is it with the moslems all are sound and safe replied they and we came not but out of concern for you then the chief of the army dismounted and kissing ground before sharrkan asked o my lord how be the sultan and the wazir dandan and rustam and my brother bahram are they all in safety he answered all well but who brought thee tidings of us quoth tarkash it was the holy man who told us that he had met my brother bahram and rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you but i see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious they questioned him and how did the holy man reach you and he replied walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night ten days' journey for a well girt horseman there is no doubt but that he is a saint of allah said sharrkan but where is he now they rejoined we left him with our troops the folk of the faith moving them to do battle with the rebels and the faithless thereat sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the holy man and commended the dead to his mercy saying this was writ in the book then they set out making for constantinople by forced marches and whilst they were on this enterprise behold a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons the eastern and the western from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night but sharrkan looked at it and said verily i fear lest this be the infidels who have routed the army of alislam for that this dust walleth the world east and west and hideth the two horizons north and south presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness blacker than the blackness of dismal days nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the day of doom horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case when behold they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out o people of the best of mankindfn442 the lamp which shineth in darkness blind verily the infidels have outwitted the moslems by guile for they fell upon the host of the one god whilst they deemed themselves safe from the faithless and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile so hasten to the aid of the believers in the unity of god and deliver them from those who deny him now when sharrkan heard these words his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble and alighting from his steed in amazement he kissed the recluse's hands and feet on like wise did his brother zau almakan and the rest of the foot and horse troops except the wazir dandan who dismounted not but said by allah my heart flieth from this devotee for i never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane so leave him and rejoin your comrades the moslems for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the lord of the three worlds how often have i here made razzias with king omar bin alnu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands said sharrkan put away from thee such evil thought hast thou not seen this holy man exciting the faithful to fight and holding spears and swords light so slander him not for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the piousfn443 look how he inciteth us to fight the foe and did not almighty allah love him he had cast him aforetime into fearful torment then sharrkan bade bring a nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said mount o pious man devout and virtuous but the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial that he might attain his end and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith

he prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy  when once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good byefn444

so the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen like a wily fox meditating guile and began to uplift her voice chanting the koran and praising the compassionate one and they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of alislam where sharrkan found the moslem in conquered plight and the chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight whilst the sword of greece havoc dight among the faithful the righteous and those who work uprightand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and second night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sharrkan saw the moslems in conquered plight and the chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright the cause of this weakness among the moslems was that the accursed old woman zat al dawahi the foe of the faith after seeing that bahram and rustam had set forward with their troops to join sharrkan and his brother zau almakan repaired to the camp of the mahometans before constantinople and caused the mission of the emir tarkash as hath been before said in this her purpose was to divide the moslem forces the better to weaken them then she left them and entered constantinople and called with a loud voice on the knights of the greeks saying let me down a cord that i may tie thereto this letter and do ye bear it to your king afridun that he may read it and to my son king hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding so they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following from the terriblest of tribulationsfn445 and the chiefest of all calamities zat aldawahi to king afridun greeting but afterwards of a truth i have contrived a device for destroying the moslems so bide ye quiet and content i have cozened and captured their sultan and the wazir dandan and then i returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung and i have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the emir tarkash to succour the capitves of whom there be now left but few it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man for verily the messiah looketh down upon you and the blessed virgin favoureth you and i hope of the messiah that he forget not what deed i have done when her letter came to king afridun he rejoiced with great joyance and sending at once for king hardub of greece son of zat aldawahi read the letter to him as soon as he camewhereathe was exceeding glad and said see my mother's craft verily it dispenseth with swords and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the day of dread rejoined afridun may the messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile then he bade the knights give orders for sallying outside the city and the news was noised abroad in constantinople so the nazarenes and the cohorts of the cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies and blaspheming the lord of all creatures when the chamberlain saw the sally he said behold the greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our sultan is far away and haply they have attacked us for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of king zau almakan therewith he waxed wroth and cried out ho soldiers of alislam and favourers of the true faith an you flee you are lost but if ye stand fast ye win know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the almighty is able to make it straight allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain thereupon the moslems cried out allaho akbar and the believer in the one god shouted his slogan and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore the priests and monks priested it tight girding their girdles and uplifting the crucifixes while the moslem shouted out the professions of the requiting king and verses of the koran began to sing the hosts of the compassion are one fought against the legions of satan and head flew from body of man while the good angels hovered above the people of the chosen prophet nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened now the miscreants had encompassed the moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them and the faithless greeded for victory over the faithful until day dawned and dazzled there upon the chamberlain mounted he and his men trusting thee allah would help them to victory and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post and heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead the craven turned tail and fled and the judge of death judged and sentence sped so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain then the moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent and the greek took possession of some of their tents whereupon the moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight when meanwhile behold up came sharrkan with the rest of the host of alislam and the standards of the believers in unity and having come up with them he charged the infidels and followed him zau almakan and the wazir dandan and the emirs bahram and rustam with his brother tarkash when the foe saw this they lost head and their reason fled and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous believers joined their pious comrades then sharrkan accosted the chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness and he in turn gave the prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day thereat the moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to allah in their fight for the faith but when the idolaters beheld the standards mohammedan and there on the profession of faith islamitan proclaiming the unity they shrieked woe and ruin and besought succour of the patriarchs of the monasteries then fell they to calling upon john and mary and the cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter whilst king afridun went up to consult king hardub of greece for the two kings stood one at the head of each wing right and left now there was with them also a famous cavalier lawiya highs who commanded the centre and they drew out in battle array but indeed they were full of alarm and affray meanwhile the moslems aligned their forces and thereupon sharrkan came to his brother zau almakan and said o king of the age doubtless they mean to champion it and that is also the object of our desire but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters for by forethought is one half of life wrought replied the sultan as thou wilt o companion of good counsel it is my wish added sharrkan to stand in mid line opposite the infidel with the wazir dandan on my left and thee on my right whilst the emir bahram leads the dexter wing and the emir rustam leads the wing sinistral and thou o mighty king shalt be under the standards and the ensigns for that thou art the pillar of our defence upon thee after allah is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee zau almakan thanked him therefor and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn but as things stood thus behold there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of roum and as he drew near they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule fleeing with her master from the shock of swords her housings were of white silk covered by a prayercarpet of cash mere stuff and on her back sat a shaykh an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect garbed in a gown of white wool he stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the moslem and said i am an ambassador to you all and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver so give me safe conduct and permit of speech that i communicate to you my message replied sharrkan thou art in safety fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance thereupon the old man dismounted and taking the cross from his neck placed it before the sultan and humbled himself with much humility then quoth to him the moslems what is with thee of news and quoth he i am an ambassador from king afridun for i counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the compassionate one and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular so he agreed to that and he saith to you 'verily i will ransom my army with my life so let the moslem king do as i do and with his life ransom his host and if he kill me there will be no stay left in the army of roum and if i kill him there will be no stability with the moslems when sharrkan heard this he said o monk i agree to that for it is just nor may it be gainsaid and behold i will meet him in duello and do with him derring do for i am champion of the faithful even as he is champion of the faithless and if he slay me he will have won the day and naught will remain for the moslems forces save flight so return to him o thou monk and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye so the monk returned and he rejoicing to king afridun and king hardub and told them both what sharrkan had said whereat king afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness and he said to himself no doubt but this sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance and when i shall have slain him their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered now zat aldawahi had written to king afridun of that and had told him how sharrkan was a knight of the braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him but afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow so when he heard the report of the monk that sharrkan agreed to the duello he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him the infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing and as soon as it was dawn the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade and behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain mounted on a steed of purest strain and for foray and fray full ready and fain and that knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight on his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of khalanj woodfn446 the curious work of the frank weighing a quintal then the rider uncovered his face and cried out saying whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me and whoso knoweth me not right soonfn447 shall ken who i be i am afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened shawhifn448 zat aldawahi but he had not ended speaking ere sharrkan the champion of the moslems fared forth to meet him mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore he crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne and he cried out to afridun woe to thee o accursed dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing they advanced and retreated and drew together and withdrew and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play and strife and stay with stroke of sword and lunge of lance of the two armies looking on some said sharrkan is victor and others afridun will conquer and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan then cried out king afridun to sharrkan saying by the truth of the messiah and the faith which is no liar thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble i ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a prince for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slavefn449 and see they bring thee out a charger which is not thine that thou mayst mount and return to the fight but by the truth of my faith thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and i am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse till thou approve to the cavaliers thy generous blood and skill in brunt when sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave he waxt wroth and turned towards his men meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse when lo afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at sharrkan now when the moslem turned his back he found none of the men near him and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed infidel so he wheeled round in haste and behold the javelin came at him so he swerved from it till his head was bent low as his saddle bow the weapon grazed his breast and pierced the skin of his chest for sharrkan was high bosomed whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away thereat the accursed afridun was joyful thinking he had slain him and shouted to the infidels bidding them rejoice whereat the faithless were encouraged and the faithful wept when zau almakan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him thereupon the infidels drove at the moslems the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled whilst the keen scymitar of alyaman did good work now the first to reach sharrkan was the wazir dandanand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and third night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king zau almakan saw that the accursed infidel had struck with javelin his brother sharrkan he deemed him dead and despatched cavaliers towards him and the first to reach him were the wazir dandan and the emir of the turks bahram and the emir of the daylamites rustam they found him falling from his horse so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother zau almakan then they gave him in charge to his pages and went again to do the work of cut and thrust so the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay so they called a truce and each army returned to its tents whilst all the infidels repaired to king afridun and kissed the ground before him and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over sharrkan then the king fared for constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm when king hardub came to him and said may the messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother zat aldawahi shall pray for thee know that the moslems can make no stay without sharrkan replied afridun to morrow shall end the affair when to fight i fare i will seek zau almakan and slay him and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail such was the case with the kafirs but as regards the host of alislam when zau almakan returned to his tent he thought of naught but his brother and going into the pavilion found him in evil case and sore condition whereupon he summoned for counsel the wazir dandan and rustam and bahram when they entered they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine sharrkan and they wept and said the world will not readily afford his like and they watched by him all that night and about the later hours came to them the recluse in tears when zau almakan saw him he rose in honour and the religious stroked sharrkan's wound with his hand chanting somewhat of the koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the compassionate one and the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn when he came to himself and opening his eyes moved his tongue in his mouth and spake at this zau almakan rejoiced saying of a truth the blessing of the holy man hath taken effect on him and sharrkan said praised be allah for recovery indeed i am well at this hour that accursed one played me false and but that i swerved aside lighter than lightening the throw spear had pierced through my breast so praised be allah for saving me and how is it with the moslems answered zau almakan all are weeping for thee quoth sharrkan i am well and in good case but where is the holy man now he was sitting by him and said at thy head so the prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said o my son be of good patience and allah shall increase thy reward for the wage is measured by the work sharrkan rejoined pray for me and he prayed for him as soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen the moslems sallied out to the plain and the kafirs made ready to thrust and cut then the islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight and king zau almakan and afridun made to charge one at other but when zau almakan fared forth into the field there came with him the wazir dandan and the chamberlain and bahram saying we will be thy sacrifice he replied by the holy house and zemzem and the placefn450 i will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses and when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out where is afridun that i may make him taste the cup of disgrace but when king hardub saw the case he conjured afridun not to attack him saying o king yesterday it was thy turn to fight it is mine to day i care naught for his prowess so he rushed out towards zau almakan brand in hand and under him a stallion like abjar which was antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet

on the glancing racer outracing glance  he speeds as though he
            would collar doom
his steed's black coat is of darkest jet  and likest night in
            her nightliest gloom
whose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears  like thunders
             rolling in thun d'rous boom
if he race the wind he will lead the way  and the lightning
             flash will behind him loom''fn451

then each rushed upon the opponent parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event at last zau almakan cried out his war cry and rushed upon hardub king of csareafn452 and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot when the infidels saw this they charged in a body compact and united upon zau almakan who met them amidfield and they engaged in hewing and foining till blood ran in rills then the moslems cried out allaho akbar god is most great and there is no god but the god and invoked salvation for the prophet the bringer of glad tidings the bearer of bad tidings and there befel a great fight but allah assigned victory to the faithful and defeat to the faithless the wazir dandan shouted take your blood revenge for king omar bin al nu'uman and his son sharrkan and bared his head and cried out to the turks now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse and all charged with him as men when the faithless found naught to save their lives but flight so they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number much folk also were slain while going in at the gates for the flock was great then the greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault and in fine the moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory and king zau almakan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case so he made a prostration of thanks to the bountiful and the exalted and then he came forward and gave sharrkan joy of his recovery answered he verily we are all under the benediction of this religious holy and righteous nor would you have been victorious but for his accepted orisons indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the moslemsand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and fourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when zau al makan went in to his brother sharrkan he found him sitting with the holy man by his side so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery answered he verily we are all under the benediction of this recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the moslems i found strength return to me when i heard your 'allaho akbar' for then i knew you to be victorious over your enemies but now recount to me o my brother what befel thee so he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of allah and sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess when zat aldawahi heard tell of her son's death and she still drest as a devotee her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears she kept her counsel however and feigned to the moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy but she said to herself by the truth of the messiah there remaineth no profit of my life if i burn not his heart for his brother sharrkan even as he hath burned my heart for king hardub the mainstay of christendom and the hosts of crossdom still she kept her secret and the wazir dandan and king zau almakan and the chamberlain remained sitting with sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves saying to morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege then said sharrkan to them ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up they accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion and none remained with sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman zat aldawahi he talked with her through part of the night then he stretched himself to rest and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead such was the case with sharrkan and his men but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and looking at sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep thereupon she sprang to her feet as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body and once more she sprang to her feet and going the round of the sleeping servants she cut off their heads also lest they should awake then she left the tent and made for the sultan's pavilion but finding the guards on the alert turned to that of the wazir dandan now she found him reading the koran and when his sight fell upon her he said welcome to the holy man hearing this from the wazir her heart trembled and she said the reason of my coming hither at this time is that i heard the voice of a saint amongst allah's saints and am going to him then she turned her back but the wazir said to himself by allah i will follow our devotee this night so he rose and walked after her but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps she knew that he was following her wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself unless i serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me so she turned and said to him from afar ho thou wazir i am going in search of this saint that i may learn who he is and after learning this much i will ask his leave for thee to visit him then i will come back and tell thee for i fear thine accompanying me without having his permission lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society now when the wazir heard these words he was ashamed to answer her so he left her and returned to his tent and would have slept but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself i will go to sharrkan and chat with him till morning but when he entered into sharrkan's pavilion he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food at this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep the folk hastened to him and seeing the blood streaming set up a clamour of weeping and wailing then the noise awoke the sultan who enquired what was the matter and it was said to him sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered so he rose in haste and entered the tent and found the wazir dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him weeping and crying out and so remained for a while till he came to himself when he looked at sharrkan and wept with sore weeping while the wazir and rustam and bahram did the like but the chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself such was his alarm then said zau almakan know ye who did this deed and how is it i see not the devotee him who the things of this world hath put away quoth the wazir and who should have been the cause of this affliction save that devotee that satan by allah my heart abhorred him from the first because i know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous and he repeated to the king the tale of how he would have followed the religious but he forbade him whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before him who is ever near him who ever answereth prayer supplicating that he would cause the false devotee who denied allah's testimony to fall into their hands then they laid sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his farfamed virtuesand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and fifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that they laid sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his farfamed virtues then they looked for the opening of the city gate but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder but king zau almakan said by allah i will not turn back from them though i sit here for years and years till i take blood revenge for my brother sharrkan and waste constantinople and kill the king of the nazarenes even if death overcome me and i be at rest from this woeful world then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the monastery of matruhina and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him moreover he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them do ye send supplies to your households for i am resolved to abide by this city year after year till i have taken man bote for my brother sharrkan even if i die in this stead and when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied to hear is to obey thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same together with the monies to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied and acquaint them saying we are encamped before constantinople and we will either destroy it or die and albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years we will not depart hence till we take it moreover he bade the wazir dandan write to his sister nuzhat alzaman and said to him acquaint her with what hath befallen us and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that when i went out to war my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed and if she hath given birth to a boy as i have heard say hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news then he gave them somewhat of money which they pouched and set out at once and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages after they had departed zau almakan turned to the wazir dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls so the troops pushed forward but found none on the ramparts whereat they marvelled while zau almakan was troubled at the case for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the ascetic in this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone so far concerning the moslems but as regards the greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this as soon as zat aldawahi had slain sharrkan she hastened her march and reached the walls of constantinople where she called out in the greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope quoth they who art thou and quoth she i am zat al dawahi they knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up and when inside the city she went in to the king afridun and said to him what is this i hear from the moslems they say that my son king hardub is slain he answered yes and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made afridun and all who were present weep with her then she told the king how she had slain sharrkan and thirty of his servants whereat he rejoiced and thanked her and kissing her hands exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son said she by the truth of the messiah i will not rest content with killing that dog of the moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son a king of the kings of the age now there is no help for it but that i work some guile and i contrive a wile whereby to slay the sultan zau almakan and the wazir dandan and the chamberlain and rustam and bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of alislam for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of sharrkan's head no never then said she to king afridun know o king of the age that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my girdle and to break the crosses replied afridun do what thou desire i will not gainsay thee in aught and if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing for though the moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness then the accursed one when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought took ink case and paper and wrote thereon from shawahi zat al dawahi to the host of the moslems know ye that i entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand i slew your king omar bin alnu'uman in the midst of his palace moreover i slew in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave many of your men and the last i killed were sharrkan and his servants and if fortune do not stay me and satan obey me i needs must slay me your sultan and the wazir dandan for i am she who came to you in disguise of a recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits wherefore an you would be in safety after this fare ye forth at once and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce and though ye tarry here years and years ye shall not do your desire on us and so peace be yours after writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for king hardub arid on the fourth she called a knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the moslem camp when this was done she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son saying to him who took the kingship after him nothing will serve me but i must kill zau almakan and all the nobles of alislam such was the case with her but as regards what occurred to the moslems all passed three days in trouble and anxiety and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound so they waited till he had shot it among them and the sultan bade the wazir dandan take the missive and read it he perused it accordingly and when zau almakan heard it to end and understood its purport his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy and the minister dandan said by allah my heart shrank from her quoth the sultan how could this whore play her tricks upon us twice but by the almighty i will not depart hence till i fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of constantinople and he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping but when zat aldawahi arrived amongst the infidels and related to them her adventures at length they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of sharrkan there upon the moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the sultan promised his men that if it should be taken he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts but he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick growing thin as a tooth pick presently the wazir dandan came in to him and said be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come and there is no profit in this mourning how well saith the poet

whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass  what is to
             be without a failure shall become
soon the becoming fortune shall be found to be  and folly's
             brotherfn453 shall abide forlorn and glum

wherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms he replied o wazir my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home and my mind is concerned for my subjects thereupon the wazir and the bystanders wept but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of constantinople for a length of days and they being thus behold news arrived from baghdad by one of the emirs to the effect that the king's wife had been blessed with a boy and that his sister nuzhat alzaman had named him knmknfn454 moreover that the boy bid fair to be famous already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens and that she had commanded the olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise furthermore that the twain were well that the land had enjoyed abundant rains and that his comrade the fireman was established in all prosperity with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him and she ended with the greeting of peace then quoth zau al makan to the wazir dandan now is my back strengthened for that i have been blest with a son whose name is kanmakanand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and sixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child zau al makan rejoiced with great joy and cried now is my back strengthened for that i have been blessed with a sonfn455 whose name is kanmakan and he spake to the wazir dandan saying i am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account quoth the wazir thy design is good thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the koran and some began reciting the holy volume whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of allah and thus they did till the morning then zau almakan went up to the grave of his brother sharrkan and poured forth copious tears and improvised these couplets

they bore him bier'd and all who followed wept  with moses'
         shrieks what day o'erhead shook torfn456
till reached the grave which pate had made his home  dug in
           men's souls who one sole god adore
ne'er had i thought before to see my joy  borne on the bier
           which heads of bearers bore
ah no nor ere they homed thee in the dust  that stars of
           heaven earth ever covered o'er
is the tomb dweller hostage of a stead  where light and
            splendour o'er thy face shall pour
praise to restore his life her word hath pledged  cribbed and
           confined he shall dispread the more

when zau almakan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe and the wazir repeated the words of the poet

pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won  thou
            didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done
leftest this worldly house without reproach or blame  ah may
            th' ex change secure thee every benison
thou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence  for us to
            baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun
i see this world is only cheat and vanity  where man naught
           else must seek but please the truthful one

grip the leather steerin' wheel while i grip the thighs
see the lust stuck up in her eyes
maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke

dad sold every record he ever owned

gone with the sun until six oclock

verse 2
you make sacrifices every night and day
never hear the crowd scream your name
but theres a smile and a hand to hold when the show is through
id give it all up just to keep your love
but you wouldnt let me because you care too much
about watching me watch my dreams all come true

you worked overtime to buy those tickets
the gas the beer and the babysitters
just to spend one night with your baby at a country show
paid twenty damn dollars for a place to park
got in line early to grab your spot

midnights become my afternoons
when my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people
i've ghosted stand there in the room

prechorus
i should not be left to my own devices
they come with prices and vices

one day i'll watch as you're leaving
'cause you got tired of my scheming
for the last time

at teatime everybody agrees
i'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror

sometimes i feel like everybody is a sexy baby
and i'm a monster on the hill
too big to hang out slowly lurching toward your favorite city
pierced through the heart but never killed

it was just two lovers
sittin' in the car listening to blonde fallin' for each other
pink and orange skies feelin' super childish no donald glover
missed call from my mother
like where you at tonight
got no alibi

prechorus
i was all alone with the love of my life
she's got glitter for skin
my radiant beam in the night
i don't need no light to see you

it's your golden hour ohohoh
you slow down time
in your golden hour ohohoh

verse 2
we were just two lovers
feet up on the dash drivin' nowhere fast burnin' through the summer
radio on blast make the moment last she got solar power
minutes feel like hours
she knew she was the baddest
can you even imagine fallin' like i did
